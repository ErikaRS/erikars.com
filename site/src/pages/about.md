I am a Software Engineering Manager at Google in Seattle, WA. Most of my time is taken up by my two beautiful children, but when I have time I enjoy reading, crochet, photography, and cooking. I am interested in how we exist effectively in the world which means I like to think about systems, ethics, and human nature.

## Style Statement

This exploration comes from *Style Statement: Live by your own design* by Carrie McCarthy and Danielle LaPorte.

### Refined Elemental

#### Refined

**Spirit:** Refined is dignified, at ease, well mannered, and a touch old-fashioned. Good taste is at the top of their list. Refined is intentional and prefers to strategize, review things, and have a plan. Punctuality is a must, and precision is the intention. Refined likes to redesign, reorganize, replenish, purify, perfect, polish, refine. They are self-assured, and no matter the circumstances emanate class and dignity, usually suggesting ease or wealth — in spirit or materially. They strive for purity — in food, behavior, colors, and surroundings — and avoid things that are distasteful, tacky, rugged, and crude. On a bad day, Refined can be slightly prudish or snooty. They appreciate a sense of history, thoughtful presentation, and values-based living. They aim for impeccability and don’t waste time or energy on things or situations that are below their level of idealism and quality, though they will always decline or depart in the most gracious way possible.

**Look & feel:** Polished, poised, put together. Sophisticated, classic, traditional, elegant; clean lines, from crisp and tailored to graceful and fluid. Ranges from old world to contemporary designs. Smooth, not course. Purified, refined materials. Also organic materials, raw minerals, polished finished.

#### Elemental

**Spirit:** Elemental is interested in the underlying forces of life: what inspires and moves people, the miracle and majesty of nature, the machinations of science and engineering, the mysteries of the universe. They love to unearth the guiding theme or architecture of things, and if answers and origins can’t be found, they will devise their own theories and stories. Fantastical, ethereal, gossamer, fluid, and having a mischievous sense of humor, Elemental is a dreamer who loves to bring the magical into everyday life. They often find themselves at the intersection of art and science. They are incredibly adept at juggling logic and faith, gentleness and passion, fluidity and force. The can easily go off on tangents and may become untethered from practicalities. Balance is critical to their success on all levels. They love to roam and explore, so they usually feel at home wherever they are. They relish good conversation about the divine, physics, psychology, and cultural tides. They are philosophers at heart and need creative outlets to wonder aloud and express their perceptions of the world.
