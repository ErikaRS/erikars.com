- 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 1 ounce square semisweet chocolate (chopped) melted
- 1 cup flour
- 1 egg white, beaten until frothy
- 1 cup broken walnuts
- 1/3 cup cherry preserves
- White chocolate

Cream together butter, sugar, salt, and egg yolk until light and fluffy. Blend in melted chocolate. Stir in flour. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Put the beaten egg white in a bowl. Put the walnuts in another bowl. Then shape the dough into 1 inch balls. Dip each ball in egg white to coat them and roll in nuts. Place 2 1/2 inches apart on the cookie sheet. Press down the center of each ball with your thumb to make a clear indentation. Bake for 8 minutes.

Remove from oven and press the center again. Bake 8 minutes longer or until firm. Cool slightly. Then spoon some cherry preserves and white chocolate into the indentations in each cookie.

Makes 3 dozen.
