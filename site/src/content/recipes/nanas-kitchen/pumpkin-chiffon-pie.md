- 1 partially baked 9 1/2 inch pie crust made with 2 teaspoons sugar or ginger snap crust
- 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar 5 eggs, separated
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 2 cups pumpkin purée Pinch salt
- 1/2 cup heavy cream 5 tablespoons melted butter
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Combine the brown sugar, egg yolks, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. In another bowl, mix the pumpkin, cream, and butter. Combine the two mixtures.

Beat the whites with a pinch of salt. When they reach soft peaks, slowly add the granulated sugar. Continue beating until it forms stiff but not dry peaks. Fold the whites into the pumpkin mixture. Pour into prepared shell.

Bake for 40-45 minutes. Filling should be set but still a little jiggly in the middle. If it seems to be browning too quickly, cover the edges with foil.
