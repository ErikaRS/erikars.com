- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 2 egg whites, beaten until frothy with a fork
- 2 cups chopped walnuts
- Jelly or melted semisweet chocolate chips for filling

Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cream the butter. Add sugar and egg yolks. Beat until smooth. Add flour and mix well. Put the egg whites and nuts in separate bowls.

Shape the dough into balls and dip into beaten egg whites to coat, then coat with walnuts. Press down into the center of each cookie to make an indentation.

Bake for 15 minutes. Fill centers with jelly or melted chocolate chips.

Makes about 48 cookies.
