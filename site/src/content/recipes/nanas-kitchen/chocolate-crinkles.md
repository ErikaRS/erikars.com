- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 4 eggs
- 2 teaspoon vanilla
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, melted
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Mix oil, chocolate, and granulated sugar. Blend in the eggs, one at a time until well mixed. Add vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking powder and salt. Chill the dough for several hours or overnight.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Put the powdered sugar in a bowl. Roll the dough into balls about 1 inch wide. If the dough is sticky, flour your hands. Drop the balls into the powdered sugar. Toss the balls so they are coated in the sugar.

Place about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet.

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until just set. These are best a little underdone. Cool on a rack. Keep any extras in a sealed tin so they don’t dry out.
