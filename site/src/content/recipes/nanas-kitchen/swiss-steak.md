This is made in a pressure cooker.

- 2 pounds Round steak at least 1 inch thick
- Flour, salt and pepper 2
- tablespoons oil
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 15 ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 1 medium onion diced

Cut meat into serving pieces. Season with salt and pepper and roll in flour. Heat pressure cooker and add the oil. Sear the meat until golden brown on both sides.

Add onion, tomatoes, and water. Close cover securely. Cook for 15 minutes. Let pressure drop of its own accord.

If desired thicken gravy with flour dissolved in water.

Serve with mashed potatoes.

Note: When we were growing up NaNa always made us our favorite meal for our birthdays. The family joke was that for many years Aunt Lori told NaNa that this was Aunt Roni’s favorite meal. Aunt Lori’s birthday was in July and it was too heavy a meal for the summer. Since it was Aunt Lori’s favorite meal she got it every December for Aunt Roni’s birthday.
