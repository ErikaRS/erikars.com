- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 5 medium Yukon gold or other waxy potatoes (not Idahos), sliced
- 1 pound ground beef
- Flour
- Salt and pepper

Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the potatoes and onions with salt and pepper to taste and cook until the potatoes are browned and almost cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.

Season the beef with salt and pepper and form into 4 patties. Add to the potato mixture, cover, and cook until the patties are cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the patties from the pan.

Add about 3 tablespoons flour to the potato/onion mixture and stir to form a gravy. Keep stirring to remove any lumps.

Return the patties to the potato mixture and coat them with the gravy.

Note: Scott learned to make this from Nanny and hasn’t made it in 25 years, but this is how he remembers it.
