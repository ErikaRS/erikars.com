- 6 eggs, separated
- 1 cup sugar, divided in halves
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 cup ground almonds
- 1/2 cup dry white breadcrumbs, slightly toasted
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Crème patisserie, chocolate, mocha, or lemon filling
- Whipped cream

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease the bottom of an 8 or 9 inch springform pan. Beat the yolks in a mixing bowl until light, gradually adding 1/2 cup sugar. Beat until very

fluffy. Beat in the lemon juice, rind, and cinnamon. Fold in the almonds. Then fold in the breadcrumbs and the almond extract.

Beat the egg whites until foamy. Beat in the cream of tartar, salt and continue beating, adding the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in gradually until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Fold into the yolk mixture just enough to combine well.

Turn into the springform pan. Bake about 50-60 minutes or until the cake pulls away from the pan.

Once cool, split into 2 layers and fill with crème patisserie, or chocolate, mocha or lemon filling. Frost with whipped cream.

Serves 12.

Note: To split the cake, use a serrated knife and work slowly across. Or you can use dental floss.
