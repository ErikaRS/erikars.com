**Batter:**

- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup flour
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Whirl all ingredients in a blender or food processor. Cover and chill for 2 hours, or overnight.

**Filling:**

- 5 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 12 ounces cooked brisket or pot roast, cubed
- 1 egg
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- Pepper

Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the onions and cook for 10 minutes, or until the onions are very soft and brown. Put the onions with their oil through a meat grinder with the cooked meat. Stir in the egg and season with salt and pepper.

**Assembly:**

- Vegetable oil

Remove the batter from the refrigerator and stir to blend if mixture has separated.

Heat a 6 inch crepe pan until hot, coat with a light layer of oil. Pour just under 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan and rotate the pan until the batter evenly coats the bottom. If there is excess batter, pour it back into the uncooked batter.

When the crepe is nicely browned on the bottom, remove it to a plate. Add more oil if needed and continue cooking crepes until all the batter has been used. You should have about 24 crepes.

To make the blintzes, take the crepes, one at a time, and place them, browned side up, on your work surface. Place about 2 tablespoons filling on the crepe, one-third of the way up from the bottom. Fold the bottom over the filling; then fold the sides over. Roll up the blintz.

When all the blintzes are formed, heat some oil in a skillet and cook the blintzes over medium heat until browned on all sides.

Makes 24 3 inch blintzes. Three blintzes are an average luncheon portion.
