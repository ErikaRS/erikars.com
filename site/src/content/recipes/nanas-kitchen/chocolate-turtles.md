These candies should look like turtles with pecans for legs and head.

- 1/2 pound soft caramel candies
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 cup pecan halves
- 4 ounces semisweet chocolate

Melt the caramels with the cream in a pot over simmering water. Or place the caramels and cream in a glass bowl and heat slowly in the microwave until the caramels are melted. Stir the mixture until it is smooth. Set aside to cool for about 10 minutes.

Arrange the pecan halves on wax paper in clusters of three, forming triangles. Spoon caramel mix over nuts leaving tips of head and legs showing. Let stand until set, about 1/2 hour.

Partially melt the chocolate over hot water in a double boiler or in the microwave. Remove from heat and stir rapidly until it is entirely melted. Spread the chocolate over caramel mixture.

Makes about 2 dozen turtles.

Note: NaNa used Baker’s chocolate but there are better chocolates on the market now. Can use bittersweet chocolate as well.
