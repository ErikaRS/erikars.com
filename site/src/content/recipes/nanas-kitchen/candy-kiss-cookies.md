- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter (at room temperature for mixer; cold and cut up for processor)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 extra large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans
- 60 Hershey kisses (unwrapped)
- Powdered sugar
- In a medium bowl of mixer or food processor fitted with the metal blade, mix flour and butter until creamy. Add sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until blended. Stir in the nuts and mix just until smooth.

Place dough on a flat surface, divide into two pieces. Shape each into a ball, then flatten, wrap in wax paper, and chill for a few hours. It will keep in the refrigerator up to one week and may be frozen.

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Break off small pieces of dough. Wrap each piece of dough around a candy kiss so you

can’t see the chocolate. Place on ungreased baking sheets and bake 18-20 minutes, or until cookies are solid and bottoms are lightly browned.

Place powdered sugar in a bowl.

Remove the cookies from the baking sheet and immediately roll in powdered sugar to coat. Cool on a rack. Roll in powdered sugar again.

These can be frozen. Makes 60 cookies.
