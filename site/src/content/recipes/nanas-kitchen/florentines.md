- 1 cup blanched almonds, very finely chopped
- 2/3 cup candied orange or lemon peel finely chopped
- 1/3 cup sifted flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1 egg beaten
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- 2 4 ounce package sweet baking chocolate

These cookies spread a lot so don’t try to bake too many at a time.

Heat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine everything but the chocolate and blend thoroughly. Spoon a level tablespoon of the batter on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of room. Spread the batter so the dough is about 3 1/2 inches in diameter.

Make only 4 cookies at a time.

Bake for 8 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned around the edges. Remove them carefully from the baking sheet immediately and cool on wire rack. When all cookies are cool, melt the chocolate. Turn the cookies over and spread melted chocolate to cover the bottom of each cookie. Cool until chocolate is firm.

Note: NaNa used Baker’s chocolate but any good semisweet or bittersweet chocolate will work. NaNa marked this recipe “Good.”
