- 1/3 cup poppy seeds 1 1/4 cups buttermilk Soak at least 15 minutes
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter 1 1/2 cup sugar
- 4 eggs, separated
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa (optional)
- Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a Bundt pan.

Soak the poppy seeds in the buttermilk for at least 15 minutes. Drain, reserving both liquid and poppy seeds.

Beat the butter with the sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks and almond extract. Stir the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Beginning with the buttermilk, alternate adding the buttermilk and flour mixture to the sugar mixture. Stir in the poppy seeds.

In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold into the batter. Then spoon into the prepared pan.

Bake for 45 minutes. Check and see if it is done.

Note: NaNa included an optional direction. Pour half the batter into the pan. Then sprinkle on the sugar/cocoa mix. Using a knife, spread it through the batter to marbleize it. Do not mix too well. You want streaks of chocolate to show. Then top with the remaining batter.
