- 4 sheets matzo
- 2 eggs
- Butter

In a mixing bowl, break the matzo into 1 inch pieces. Pour warm water over the matzo and soak for 5 minutes. Drain the water of the matzo and squeeze the matzo to get rid of excess water.

In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork. Mix the eggs with matzo. Over medium heat, heat

the butter in a large sauté pan. Drop 1/2 cup of matzo in the frying pan and flatten to

form a round pancake. Fry until crisp. Flip over to fry the other side.

Serve with maple syrup.

Note: You can also pour all the matzo in the frying pan and fry until crisp. Flip over to fry the other side, breaking into pieces as it cooks.
