- 1 1/2 pounds brisket with some bone or short ribs
- 1 large onion cut into wedges
- 5 cups water, enough to cover the meat
- Salt and pepper
- 1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch slices
- 1 pound new potatoes (red-yellow-Yukon gold) peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks
- 1/4 cup sugar to taste

**Knaidlach (Dumplings):**

- 3 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 onion minced
- 1/8 cup oil or schmaltz (chicken fat)
- 2 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 1/4 cup flour mixed with
- 1/2 cup water

Put meat and onion in a large pot. Add the water and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Make sure the water covers the meat. If not add more water. Salt and pepper. When the meat is almost done add the carrots and potatoes along with the sugar and more salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking until the vegetables are almost done.

If the meat is done first, remove it. Test the meat with a fork, if it removes easily the meat is done.

Make the knaidlach mixture. In a mixing bowl beat the eggs. Add the minced onion, oil or schmaltz and water, then add enough flour so the dough comes together but is sticky. Stir in salt and pepper. Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil and drop in the knaidlach off a large spoon. Lower the heat so the liquid simmers and cook until the knaidlach are done, about 30 minutes. If the Tzimmes is watery stir in some more flour and water mixture and let it simmer a few more minutes. The Tzimmes should be fairly thick.

Note: For Passover use matzo meal for the knaidlach instead of the flour. The meat is usually served separately though there are bits of it left in the Tzimmes.
