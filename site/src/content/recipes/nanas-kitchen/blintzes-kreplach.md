- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 large egg
- 4-6 tablespoons warm water
- 1/3 recipe filling for meat blintzes (See page 88)
- Chicken stock

Put the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add the egg and process just until blended. With the machine running, slowly pour in the water. Stop when the dough just begins to come together. Remove the dough to a work surface and knead gently but firmly for a few minutes until the dough is very smooth.

Divide the dough in half. Cover one half to keep it from drying out. Roll the other half out on the work surface to an 8×12 inch rectangle between 1/16 and 1/8 inch thick. If the dough won’t hold its shape, let it rest for a few minutes and then roll again. Cut the dough into 2 inch squares.

Place about 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each square. Fold the squares over into triangles, pressing well along the sides to seal. Set aside to dry. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.

Bring the stock to a boil and add the kreplach. Cook about 20 minutes. Serve in the soup.

Makes about 48 kreplach.

Note: Extra kreplach may be frozen.
