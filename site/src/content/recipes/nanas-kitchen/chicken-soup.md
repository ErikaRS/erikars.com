This is made in a pressure cooker.

- 1 whole chicken
- 1 large onion peeled
- 2 or 3 carrots peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces 2 parsnips peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
- 2 celery stalks cut in half
- 1 bunch of fresh dill 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white pepper

Remove gizzards, neck and heart from the inside of the chicken and wash under cold water. Place into the pressure cooker.

Put the peeled whole onion inside the cavity of the chicken. Add the carrots, parsnips and celery. Add enough water to just cover the chicken. Add salt and pepper. Place cover on pressure cooker and lock it in place. Put cooker on the stove and turn it on to high.

Once the pressure starts to build and it starts rocking or hissing turn the stove down to low heat. This is when you start the cooking time. Let it cook for 20 minutes. Let pressure drop of its own accord. Pressure is down when no steam escapes.

Remove cover. Carefully remove the chicken to a bowl to shred. Remove the onion. Save the carrots and parsnips to put in soup. Strain the soup over a colander into a bowl so you just have the broth.

Discard everything else. To serve put a couple of ladles of soup in a bowl. Add a couple of carrots and parsnips. Next you can put in either Kreplach or Matzo balls and some egg noodles if you like. You can add some chicken too. NaNa never did for the holidays.

Note: You can make chicken salad with the leftover chicken.
