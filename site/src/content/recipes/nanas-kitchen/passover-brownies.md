- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 cups packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup Passover cake meal
- 1/2 cup potato starch
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 egg whites, beaten until stiff
- 1 cup nuts (optional)

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Grease a 9×13 pan.

Mix the melted butter with the cocoa. Set aside.

Beat the egg yolks and sugar. Add dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Stir in the chocolate mixture. Fold in the nuts (if wanted), then gently fold in the beaten egg whites. Mix just until you can’t see any white.

Bake for 30 minutes.
