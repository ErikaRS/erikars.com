Bottom layer:

- 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup flour

Topping:

- 2 eggs
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 cup shredded coconut
- Pinch of salt
- Semisweet chocolate chips (optional)

Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease an 8 inch square pan.

For the bottom layer, cream the butter and sugar together. Then beat in the flour. Spread in the pan and bake for 20 minutes.

While it is baking, make the topping. Beat the eggs with the brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the vanilla, pecans, coconut, flour and salt.

Spread over baked bottom and bake for another 20 minutes.

Note: NaNa says she would melt chocolate chips on top to make it look better. Sprinkle the chips on the warm pecan squares and spread them into a thin layer. The heat of the squares should melt the chocolate.
