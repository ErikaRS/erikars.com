- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 2 cups unbroken pecans

In a 9×13 baking dish melt butter in a 350 degree oven. Add the brown sugar to the baking dish. When butter is melted mix together with the brown sugar and press in bottom of the baking dish forming a crust. Arrange the pecans in neat rows in the sugar mixture, tops facing down. This will be the top of the kugel.

- 1 pound wide egg noodles
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cook the noodles, drain and mix with the rest of the ingredients. Spread in the prepared pan and bake for 1 hour. Turn the noodle kugel immediately over onto a deep serving plate so pecans are on top. If not serving immediately turn over onto a jelly roll pan. Warm before serving.
