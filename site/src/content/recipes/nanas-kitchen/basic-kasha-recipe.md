- 1 egg, slightly beaten
- 1 cup kasha
- 2 cups actively boiling water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

Stir the egg into the kasha. Spoon into frying pan on high flame and stir constantly about 3-5 minutes.

When each grain is dry and separated, stir in the boiling water, butter, salt and pepper. Cover tightly and reduce heat to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the kasha is tender and all liquid is absorbed.

Serve with gravy.

Variation: Sauté 1/2 cup chopped onions and/or mushrooms in oil or butter. Add to kasha.
