**Dough:**

- 2 eggs
- 1 cup lukewarm water 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 cup oil
- 2 teaspoons white vinegar
- 3 1/4 – 4 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder

Beat the eggs, water, and salt in the large bowl of a mixer. Then slowly add the oil, vinegar, flour, and baking soda. The dough should be smooth, not too sticky.

Cover bowl and let stand for 15 minutes.

**Filling:**

- 5 pounds potatoes, peeled
- 3 pounds onions, sliced Vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste.

Boil the potatoes until soft.

Heat the oil and cook the onions until they are brown and crispy, about 15 minutes. While they are still hot, push the onions and potatoes through a food mill with a medium blade. Or use a ricer. Season with salt and pepper.

**Assembly:**

- Dough
- Filling
- Vegetable oil

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roll out dough into a 16 inch square. Divide the filling into halves, thirds or fourths depending on the size of knishes you want. Brush oil on dough. Then spread part of the filling along one side, about 1/2 inch in from the edge.

Roll the dough over the filling twice. Cut along the roll with a knife so you have a long piece of stuffed dough and the rest of the dough isn’t covered yet.

Pinch the ends of the roll to seal. Then using your hand as a knife, cut the roll, with a sawing motion, into individual pieces, 1-2 inches long. Pinch one side of each piece. Place them pinched sides down on a baking sheet. Pinch the tops until almost closed. Repeat with the rest of the filling and dough.

Bake for 30-45 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot.

You can freeze extra knishes before baking. Bake them frozen for 5-10 minutes longer.
