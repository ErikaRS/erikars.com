**Dough:**

- 3 eggs, well beaten
- 1 cup sugar
- 3/4 cup oil
- 1/4 cup orange juice
- 4 cups flour
- 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder

**Filling:**

- 6 ounces dried apricots
- 12 ounces pitted prunes
- 6 ounces golden raisins
- 1/2 cup crushed pineapple
- 1/2 cup pine-cot jam (pineapple-apricot)
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

**Dough:**

Mix the eggs, sugar, oil, and juice. Add the flour and baking powder. Mix well. Wrap in wax paper or foil and refrigerate overnight.

**Filling:**

Grind the apricots, prunes, and raisins in a grinder, not food processor. Stir in the pineapple, jam, and cinnamon. (If using chunks of pineapple, put them through the grinder).

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Roll out 1/3 of the dough on a floured surface. Cut rounds with a 2 or 3 inch cookie cutter. Place about a teaspoon of filling in the center. If you don’t know how to shape them, you shouldn’t be making them.

Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.
