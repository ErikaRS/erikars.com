Dough:

- 6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 cups flour

Filling:

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Dash salt
- 1 1/3 cup coarsely broken pecans

**Dough**

Blend together the cream cheese and butter. Stir in flour and mix until smooth. Cover and chill for about 1 hour. If the dough gets too firm, let it sit at room temperature to soften a bit.

Roll pieces of dough into 1 inch balls. Place the balls in tiny ungreased muffin cups. Press it to evenly cover the bottom and sides of each cup.

Heat the oven to 325 degrees.

**Filling**

Beat together the butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth.

Divide half the pecans among the pastries. Fill with mixture and then top with remaining nuts. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the filling is set.

Cool and remove from the tins. Makes about 24.

Note: These are like little pecan pies.
