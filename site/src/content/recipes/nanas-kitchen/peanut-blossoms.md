- 1/2 cup (1 stick) shortening or unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 3/4 cup flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Granulated sugar for rolling 7 ounces Hershey’s kisses (about 56)

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl or with an electric mixer, beat together the butter, peanut butter, and sugars. Then beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla. When it is smooth, blend in the flour and salt. Mix thoroughly.

Place the granulated sugar for rolling in a bowl.

Using a teaspoon, shape the dough into balls. Drop the balls in the sugar bowl and roll them to coat. Place the cookies on ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven but leave the oven on. Place a candy kiss on each cookie, pressing down so it breaks around edge. Place back in oven for 2-5 minutes longer.

Makes about 56 cookies.
