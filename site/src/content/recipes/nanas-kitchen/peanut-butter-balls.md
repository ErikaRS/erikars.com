title: Peanut Butter Balls
---

- 1 cup crunchy peanut butter
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup crushed peanuts
- 6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 Shabbos candle

Mix the first six ingredients together in a bowl. Make into 1 inch balls and put onto wax paper. Melt the chocolate chips, butter, and Shabbos candle over hot water.

Dip the balls using a toothpick into the chocolate and coat with chocolate. Set aside on wax paper. Let cool.

Note: NaNa used a Shabbos candle in her coating, but it’s not considered a good idea any more. You can just coat the balls in melted chocolate or add a little (1 tablespoon) vegetable oil to the chocolate.
