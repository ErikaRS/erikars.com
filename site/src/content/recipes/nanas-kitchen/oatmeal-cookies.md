- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/2 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon 3 cups oatmeal (quick cooking or old fashion)
- 1 cup raisins (optional)

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.

Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Add to batter mixture, mixing well. Stir in oats.

Drop by rounded tablespoons or small scoop onto ungreased cookie sheet. (You can use foil or parchment paper to line the pan if you like). Leave about 2 inches between the cookies since they will spread when they bake.

Bake 8-9 minutes for a chewy cookie or 10-11 minutes for a crisp cookie. Cool 1 minute on cookie sheet then remove to cooling rack. Store in tightly covered container.

Makes about 42 to 48 cookies.
