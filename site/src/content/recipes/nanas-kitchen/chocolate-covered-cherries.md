Cherry mixture:

- 4 ounce package cream cheese, softened 4 tablespoons melted butter
- 2 cups powdered sugar 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 cup angel flake coconut (sweetened) 1 8 or 10 ounce jar maraschino cherries, drained and chopped

Coating:

- 12 ounces (2 cups) semisweet chocolate chips 1/4 bar paraffin

Beat the cream cheese, butter and sugar until well blended. Add nuts, coconut and cherries. Chill overnight. Form into small balls. Chill another 5-6 hours.

For the coating, melt together the chocolate chips and paraffin. Dip each candy ball in the chocolate. Put on cookie sheet lined with wax paper or parchment and return to the refrigerator to set. Keep refrigerated.

Makes 6 dozen.

Note: NaNa used paraffin in her coating, but it’s not considered a good idea any more. You can just coat the cherry mixture in melted chocolate or add a little (1 tablespoon) vegetable oil to the chocolate.
