- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter
- 1 heaping cup flour
- 7 cups water
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 pound canned tomatoes, cut up
- 1/4 cup beef stock base (Carmel Kosher)
- 1 pound ground chuck or lean hamburger meat
- 1 pound package frozen vegetables

Melt the butter in a pot. Stir in the flour and water with a wooden spoon. Add the carrot onions, celery, tomatoes, and stock base.

In a skillet, sauté the meat and drain off the fat. Then add meat to mixture and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add frozen vegetables after 2 hours and cook for an additional hour.

Freezes very well.
