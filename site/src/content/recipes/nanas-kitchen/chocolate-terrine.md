- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup coffee
- 3/4 cup sugar 4 eggs, beaten

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a loaf pan with foil. Have a larger pan ready to place the loaf pan in to make a water bath.

Place the chocolate and butter in a metal bowl. Put the bowl over a saucepan filled with barely simmering water. Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Whisk until smooth and melted.

Add the coffee and sugar and continue whisking to dissolve the sugar. Continue cooking  
until very hot, approximately 120 degrees.

Remove bowl from heat and whisk in the eggs. Pour mixture into the loaf pan. Place the pan in the larger pan and add boiling water to fill the larger pan about halfway. Bake for 40 minutes.

Let cool, then chill overnight. Remove from the loaf pan the next day and serve in slices, preferably with ice cream.

Note: NaNa recommends serving this with white chocolate raspberry ice cream.
