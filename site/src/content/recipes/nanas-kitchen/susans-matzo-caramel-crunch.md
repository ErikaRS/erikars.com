- 4-6 matzos
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 3/4 cup chocolate chips

Heat oven to 375 degrees.

Line a large or 2 smaller cookie sheets completely with foil. Cover the foil with parchment paper on top. This is very important. Line the bottom of the cookie sheet evenly with the matzo, cutting extra pieces as required to fit the pan.

In a heavy 3 quart saucepan, combine the butter and brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and pour over the matzo. Covering completely.

Place the sheet in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 350 degrees. Bake for 15 minutes. Check a few times to make sure the mixture isn’t burning. If it seems to be browning too quickly remove the pan from the oven, lower the heat to 325 degrees and replace the pan.

Remove from oven and sprinkle immediately with the chocolate chips. Let stand for 5 minutes then spread the melted chocolate over the matzo. While still warm break into squares or odd shapes.

Note: This makes a good gift. You may use white chocolate, milk chocolate or dark chocolate; also nuts.
