---

- 2 cups cooked wild rice
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons minced shallots
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons clarified butter
- 2 teaspoons oil

Place the wild rice, eggs, shallots, and garlic in a mixing bowl. Stir, then add the flour, cream and salt and pepper. Heat the clarified butter and oil in a sauté pan over medium heat.

Once the fat is hot, drop a large spoonful of the batter into the pan to form one pancake.

Cook for 4-5 minutes or until top begins to look dry and bottom is golden. Turn with a spatula and cook the other side for 3 minutes.

Makes 8 pancakes.

Note: The recipe calls for clarified butter, but you can just use oil.
