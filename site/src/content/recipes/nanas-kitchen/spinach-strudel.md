title: Spinach Strudel
---

- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped 1 pound (2 sticks) melted butter
- 2 10 ounce packages frozen spinach, thawed and drained
- 6 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1/2 pound feta
- 4 ounces cottage cheese
- 4 ounces mozzarella
- 2 tablespoons farina or bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup chopped parsley 1/2 cup minced dill
- Salt and pepper and nutmeg to taste
- 1 pound phyllo dough

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Sauté both onions in the butter until soft. Add the rest of the ingredients. Use to fill the phyllo.

Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll the puff pastry on your baking sheet, leaving it on the paper it is rolled up with. Spread the spinach filling over the pastry, leaving 1/2 inch free all around the edges. Use your hands to distribute the mixture evenly.

Fold in the edges of the dough on the short sides. Roll the strudel lengthwise away from you into a log while keeping the ends folded in and using the pastry paper to help lift and roll the strudel with its filling. Peel away the paper as you roll and finish with the seam down. With a scissors, trim away the excess paper.

Brush the top and sides of strudel with the rest of the beaten egg. Using a sharp knife, make holes or diagonal slits in the top of the strudel for steam to escape. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is a deep, golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow the strudel to stand for about 10 minutes before cutting. Leftovers keep for one day in the refrigerator.
