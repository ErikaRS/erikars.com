- 1 1/2 cups milk
- cup shortening or butter,
- 2 packages yeast
- 1/2 cup tepid water
- cut into pieces
- 6 cups flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt

Bring the milk to a boil. Add the butter and let melt off the heat. Add the sugar and salt, blend and let cool.

Add the eggs to the cooled mixture.

Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water. Stir and let sit for 5 minutes. Add the yeast to the mixture, then add the flour and mix well. The dough will be sticky. Cover with wax paper and a cloth towel and refrigerate overnight.

Assembly:

- Dough mixture
- 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
- 3 cups sugar
- 1/2 cup cinnamon

Put the melted butter in a bowl. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in another bowl. Look for more cinnamony color than sugary. Take pieces of dough and roll them into balls about 1 1/2 inches wide. Roll each ball in butter to coat, and then into sugar mixture. Place the balls into a Bundt pan. Add enough balls to fill in the spaces up to one inch from the top of the pan. It will fill spaces on the next rise. When done, cover the pan with a towel and let rise for about 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for about 1 hour. Let cool completely. Turn out of pan to serve.
