**Dough:**

- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter, cut into 8 pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening (Crisco) or butter
- 5 tablespoons ice cold water (about)

**Filling:**

- 4-5 Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced thin
- Cinnamon
- Sugar
- Strawberry, Raspberry or Apricot jam
- Oil

Put the flour, butter, shortening, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Turn processor on and off rapidly until the butter and shortening are cut into the flour and small bits form. Do not over mix. About 10 seconds.

Add the cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, processing until a ball of dough forms on the blade. Stop as soon as the dough comes together. You might not use all the water. Wrap dough in waxed paper and refrigerate overnight. It will keep for 3-4 days.

In a bowl, coat the sliced apples with cinnamon and sugar.

Roll dough out into a rectangle and put oil around the edges to help seal. Smear strawberry, raspberry or apricot jam onto dough. Put apples that you have cut thin mixed with cinnamon and sugar over dough. Roll up horizontally and fold the long edges over.

Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes than bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. Bake on foil lined cookie sheet. When done baking remove kugel immediately from baking sheet and place on a new foil wrapped baking sheet to keep from sticking.
