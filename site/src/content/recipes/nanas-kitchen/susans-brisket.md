Brisket usually has a layer of fat on it. Don’t trim much of it away because it gives the brisket flavor. You can remove much of the fat later after it’s cooked. Don’t add any liquid other than that given off by the onions but some people add stock or wine.

- 3 1/2 pounds brisket
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika plus for onions
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- Fresh ground pepper
- 3 pounds onions, thickly sliced

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Slice 2 cloves of garlic. Make small holes in the brisket (on both sides) with a knife and put pieces of garlic in the holes. Rub paprika, salt, and pepper over both sides of the meat. Place in a roasting pan, fat side down. Roast for 15 minutes. Turn the meat over and roast for about 30 minutes. Add some onions to the pan. They don’t all fit in at the beginning. Season the onions with more paprika, salt, and pepper. Cover pan tightly with foil and return to the oven. After about an hour, add more onions. Stir so they are covered with fat and seasonings. Continue until all the onions are added.

Roast until the meat is fork tender, about 4 hours. Let cool. Separate the onions from the meat and refrigerate. Once cool, it is easy to remove much of the fat and it is easy to slice. Slice across the grain. Reheat before serving.

Leftovers freeze well. You can also use them for meat blintzes.
