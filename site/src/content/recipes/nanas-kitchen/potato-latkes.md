- 6 medium potatoes
- 3 eggs
- 1 large onion
- 1/2 cup matzo meal or flour
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Oil for frying

Grate potatoes and onions into a bowl. Use a box grater or food processor. Squeeze the mixture to eliminate excess liquid. Then stir in the matzo meal, eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix well.

Heat oil until hot in frying pan. Drop about 1/4 cup of mixture at a time. Do not crowd the pan. When brown on the bottom, turn and cook the other side.

Put on paper towels to soak up oil.

Serve with applesauce, sour cream, or strawberry jam.
