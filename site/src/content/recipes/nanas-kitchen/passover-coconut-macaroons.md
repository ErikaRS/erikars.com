- 1 cup Baker’s Angel Flake Coconut (sweetened)
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons Passover cake meal
- 1/8 teaspoon salt (optional)
- 2 egg whites
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

Combine coconut, sugar, cake meal and salt (if you use it) in a bowl and stir in unbeaten egg whites and almond extract. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a lined cookie sheet.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until edges are browned. Remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack at once. Makes about 18 if you use teaspoon, 15 if you use a tablespoon.

Note: NaNa used foil on the pans and sprayed them with Pam.
