- 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 cup flour
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 egg whites, beaten stiff
- Ice cream or whipped cream.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a jelly roll pan with greased parchment paper.

Sift together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Beat egg yolks until thick and lemon colored. Add the sifted dry ingredients and beat until well blended. Add the vanilla. Then fold in the egg whites, mixing them well but gently. Spread the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake 15-20 minutes.

Have a clean dish towel ready and sprinkle powdered sugar on top. When the cake is done, flip it onto the towel. Lift off the pan and the peel off the parchment paper. Spread with ice cream or whipped cream and roll up.

Note: NaNa used to fill this with ice cream. Any flavor will do.
