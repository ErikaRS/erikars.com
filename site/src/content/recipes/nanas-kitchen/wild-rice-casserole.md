- 1 cup wild rice
- 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced (usually button mushrooms)
- 3 tablespoons minced onion
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds or sliced water chestnuts
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the wild rice under running water and drain. Combine rice, mushrooms, onions, and almonds or water chestnuts in a 2 quart casserole.

Add broth and dot with butter.

Cover and bake until the rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 1 1/2 hours.
