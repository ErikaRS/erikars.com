- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- Powdered sugar

In a large bowl (preferably of an electric mixer), cream together butter and powdered sugar until light and fluffy. Add salt, vanilla, flour, and pecans. Beat until thoroughly mixed.

Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Wrap each separately in wax paper. Refrigerate until cold enough to shape.

Heat the oven to 325 degrees.

Remove dough from the refrigerator, one portion at a time. Pinch off pieces of the cold dough. Use your hands to roll the dough into rounds about 1 inch wide. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Leave room for them to spread a little. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until the cookies are lightly browned.

Place the powdered sugar in a bowl.

As soon as the cookies are done, remove them from the pan and drop them into the powdered sugar. Use a spoon to roll them over and coat completely with the sugar. Place on a rack to cool. When cool, roll in more powdered sugar.

Makes about 48 cookies.
