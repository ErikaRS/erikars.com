- 2 eggs
- 1 cup milk

Heavily grease six 5 ounce glass custard cups or a 6 cup jumbo muffin pan.

Into a bowl mix the ingredients together just until the eggs are well blended. Disregard lumps. Pour the mixture into the custard cups, filling them about 3/4 full.

Place the filled cups in a cold oven. Set oven at 450 degrees. Do not open oven for at least 1/2 hour. Popovers should be tall and brown.

Remove from oven. Puncture four sides of neck to let out steam. Return to oven for 15 minutes with heat off.
