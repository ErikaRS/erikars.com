- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 2 1/4 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups)

Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine the butter, both sugars, and vanilla. Beat until creamy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Gradually add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in chocolate chips.

Drop by teaspoonful onto prepared pan. Leave room for them to expand.

Bake for 9-11 minutes, until brown.

Note: NaNa didn’t add nuts because not everyone liked them but you can add chopped walnuts or pecans.
