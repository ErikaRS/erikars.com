- 1 14 ounce package unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1 cup blanched almonds, chopped
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 large egg whites, not beaten

Heat oven to 325 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, combine the coconut, almonds, sugar, lemon zest, and salt. Mix in the egg whites.

Drop mounds of the mixture (each equal to 2 tablespoons) onto baking sheet, spacing them 11/2 inches apart.

Bake until edges begin to brown, 20-25 minutes.

Cool slightly on baking sheet, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Store in airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Makes about 24 cookies.
