- 1/2 cup Crisco (or margarine or butter)
- 1 1/2 cup water
- 11/2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cup matzo meal
- 4 eggs

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment or foil (or use a non-stick pan).

Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and add Crisco, sugar and salt. When the shortening is melted, add the matzo meal and stir with a wooden spoon until mixture leaves the side of the pan and forms a ball. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.

Stir in the eggs, one at a time (NaNa used an electric mixer), beating well after each addition.

Drop mixture by large tablespoons onto cookie sheet. Using a wet finger, make an

indentation in the middle of each bagelach.

Bake for 45 minutes. Makes about 12.
