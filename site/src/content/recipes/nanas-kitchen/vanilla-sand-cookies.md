- 3/4 pound (3 sticks) butter
- 3 cups flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup blanched, finely ground almonds

Heat oven to 325 degrees.

In a mixing bowl or with a mixer, work all the ingredients together with your hands until you have a smooth stiff paste.

To form the cookies, break off a small chunk, a spoonful or a bit more, and roll into a ball

between the palms of your hands. Flatten into a round, and you will have a circle with fine, cracked edges. Arrange these on a baking sheet and press a design in the top if you wish with the tines of a fork. Leave an inch between cookies so they can expand as they bake.

Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden in color.
