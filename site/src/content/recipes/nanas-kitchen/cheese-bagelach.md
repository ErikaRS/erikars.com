The dough for the bagelach is the same as the dough for potato knishes. Make sure the cheese is dry and firm. Farmer’s cheese is best but NaNa had a hard time finding it so she often used cottage cheese. If necessary, pour the cottage cheese through a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let rest for a while to let the liquid drip out.

**Filling:**

- 1 1/2 cups dry cottage cheese or farmer’s cheese 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) melted butter
- 3 eggs
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Salt

Mix ingredients together.

Assembly: Knish dough (See recipe page 84)

Melted butter Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it is a very thin square or rectangle. Brush on a thin layer of butter. Spread about half of the filling along the length of the dough, close to the edge. Roll the dough over the filling twice, then cut the dough so you have a long package filled with potatoes.

Then, using the side of your hand as a saw, cut the roll into pieces 2 inches long. Take each piece and pinch the bottom so it seals. Leave the top open and press your finger into the dough so it has sort of donut/bagel shape.

Bake for 40-45 minutes until brown. Serve with sour cream.

Extra bagelach can be frozen. Spread them out on a baking sheet so they don’t touch. Once they are frozen, place in a freezer bag. You can bake them frozen. Increase baking time 5-10 minutes.
