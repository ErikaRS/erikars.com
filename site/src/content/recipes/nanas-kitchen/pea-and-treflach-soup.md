- 2 pounds flanken or short ribs
- 2 onions, chopped
- 5 carrots, chopped
- 3 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 16 ounce bag of dry split green peas
- 1 16 ounce bag of frozen peas

Dumplings:

- 2 eggs Flour
- Water
- Salt and pepper

Brown the flanken in a soup pot. Cover with water and cook until tender. Remove from the pot and pull the meat off the bones.

In a sauté pan, brown the onions, carrots, and celery. Add to the bottom with the meat and the split peas. Cook until the split peas fall apart.

Beat the eggs with some water, then add flour, salt, and pepper. The mixture should be runny, not too thick.

Add the peas to the soup, then dribble in the flour mixture. Cover and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the dumplings are done.

Note: This is what NaNa told Susan about how to make the soup. Susan adds potatoes and leaves out the celery.
