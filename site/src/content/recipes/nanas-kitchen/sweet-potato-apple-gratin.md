title: Sweet Potato Apple Gratin
---

- 3 pounds sweet potatoes (or red yams), baked until done. Set aside to cool. Peel and cut diagonally in 1/4 inch slices.
- 3 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1/8 inch slices tossed with lemon juice

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a casserole dish, usually a 9×13 Pyrex.

Arrange the potato and apple slices alternately in the buttered casserole dish.

Heat until dissolved:

- 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup honey
- 2 tablespoons dark rum (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace

Pour over potato and apples. Bake for 30 minutes.

Note: Poke holes in the potatoes with a fork. The potatoes can be baked the night before at 400 degrees for 1 hour. Set aside to cool. The next day, peel the potatoes and slice them along with the apples and put together the casserole.
