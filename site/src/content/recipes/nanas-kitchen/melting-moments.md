- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 3/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 cup flour

Frosting:

- 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- A little cream
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

Cream together the butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Sift together the cornstarch with the flour to remove any lumps in the cornstarch. Add to the butter mixture and beat until smooth and creamy. Refrigerate 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Drop dough in small mounds on ungreased baking sheet. Leave room for the cookies to spread.

Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly brown.

Make the frosting by beating all the frosting ingredients together until smooth. Once the cookies are completely cool, frost the top of each cookie.

Note: NaNa would color the frosting with a little food coloring depending on the holiday. Red for Valentine’s day, blue for Hanukkah, green or red for Christmas.
