- 4 tablespoons fat (rendered chicken fat or vegetable oil)
- 4 eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 cup matzo meal
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup soup stock or water

Mix fat and eggs together. Add matzo meal and salt. When well blended add soup stock or water. Cover mixture in refrigerator for at least 20-30 minutes.

Using a 2-3 quart pot, bring salt water to a boil and drop in balls of matzo mixture. Cover pot and cook 30-40 minutes. Makes 8 balls.

Note: It is easier to shape the balls if you use wet hands.
