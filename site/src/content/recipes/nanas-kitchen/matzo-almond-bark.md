---

- 5-6 pieces plain matzo
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds (crushed)

Heat oven to 400 degrees.

Line a jelly roll pan with foil and lay matzo in single layer so it completely covers the pan. Melt the butter and sugar over low heat. Raise the heat and boil mixture for 3 minutes. Pour the mixture over the matzo and spread it with the back of a spoon. Place the matzo in the oven for 5 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the chocolate chips over the matzo and spread with a spatula. Sprinkle crushed almonds over the top. Refrigerate at least one hour. Break into uneven pieces and serve.

Note: You can add any toppings you want: other chips, nuts, candied ginger, coconut, etc.
