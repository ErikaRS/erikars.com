title: Oven Roasted Carrots with Tahini Dressing
---

### INGREDIENTS
- 1 lb carrots
- Kosher salt and fresh pepper
- 1/4 cup fresh mint roughly chopped
- 1 tbsp tahini
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- juice of a quarter lemon
- 1 tbsp water
- pinch of kosher salt and fresh pepper

### PREPARATION

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Peel and slice carrots lengthwise. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, enough to lightly coat the carrots, and sprinkle a couple of pinches of kosher salt and fresh pepper. Use your hands to mix and ensure the carrots are evenly coated.
Roast at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes, until tender when pierced with a fork, and browning. Flip the carrots at the roasting half point.
To make tahini dressing, add oil, tahini, lemon, water, and salt and pepper to a small mason jar with a lid and shake until well combined and smooth.
Once roasted, place in a serving bowl. Drizzle the tahini dressing over top and sprinkle a handful of roughly chopped fresh mint.
