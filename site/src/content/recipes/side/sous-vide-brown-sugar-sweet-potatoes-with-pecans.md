title: Sous-vide Brown Sugar Sweet Potatoes with Pecans
---

**Yield:** 6 to 8 servings

**Total time:** 1.75 hours

### Ingredients

- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 Tbsp dark brown sugar
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp fine sea salt, plus more to taste
- 1 Tbsp bourbon or apple cider
- 3 lbs sweet potatoes (about 3 medium-large), peeled and sliced 1/2-in thick
- 3/4 c toasted pecans, chopped (see note)

### Instructions

In a small pot, melt butter, sugar, cinnamon stick, and 1 tsp salt over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, stir in bourbon, let cool slightly.

In a large pot or heatproof container, use a sous-vide machine to heat water to 185F. Place potatoes and cooled sugar mixture in bag. Seal and let out air. Cook until sweet potatoes are completely tender, poking them several times to make sure, 75 to 90 minutes (Check after 15 minutes; you may have to let out some steam)

Transfer cooked potatoes and all the liquid from the bag to a food processor and puree until smooth. Taste and add more salt, if desired. Transfer to a serving platter and top with toasted pecans to serve.

Note: To toast the pecans, spread them out on a baking sheet and bake them in a 325F oven, stirring once or twice, until golden and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool.
