### Ingredients

- 1 c. yellow corn meal
- 1 c. all-purpose flour
- 1/4 c. granulated sugar
- 1 tbs. baking powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- pinch of brown sugar, to-taste
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 c. milk (nonfat, if you are awesome)
- 1/3 c. vegetable oil

### Instructions

Heat oven to 400F, and bust out a foil 9″ pie pan.

Mix together the dry ingredients in a fair-sized bowl (bigger than a cereal bowl, for reals). Mix the egg, milk, and oil together in a lesser bowl. Then pour the smaller into the larger. Stir until blent, ish, and then pour in a solid dollop of honey. Mix it up and pour the whole mess into the pie pan.

Bake for 24 minutes and then poke it with something (not your finger)

to see if the insides are dry.

While it is cooking, spin some melted butter with almost an equal part

of honey. You have now made honey-butter. Enjoy.

### Notes

1) Add a teaspoon (or more!) of cayenne pepper to the batter for a slight spicy kick.

2) Add finely minced jalapeño peppers (perhaps two tablespoons, more or less).

3) Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of whole corn kernels to the batter.

4) Add a small amount (perhaps 1/4 cup) of other fruits to the batter, such as blueberries, strawberries, finely chopped apple pieces, dried fruits, etc.

5) Use wheat flour (we’ve tried this modification and suggest replacing half of the white flour with wheat flour, and then adding an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the batter to keep the batter texture consistant).

6) Add extra sugar to the batter for a sweeter cornbread (5-6 tablespoons rather than 4).

7) Add both extra sugar and minced jalapenos for a spicy/sweet cornbread (it may sound like a strange taste combination, but it really works)

8) Add a 1/2 cup of grated cheddar, or other mild cheese, to the batter.

9) Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter.
