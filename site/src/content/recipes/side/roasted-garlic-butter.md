This is a wonderful thing to do when you have lots of garlic. It’s easy with fabulous flavor and can be kept in the fridge or freezer for longer storage.

### INGREDIENTS
- 2 whole bulbs garlic
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 8 ounces unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

### PREPARATION

Preheat oven to 350ºF/180ºC
Cut the garlic in half. Spread olive oil evenly over each cut half.
Rejoin the garlic bulbs and wrap tightly in aluminum foil.
Roast for 45 minutes or until golden brown and caramelized.
Cool for 10 minutes or until you can handle it.
Open the foil and let the garlic cool until you can handle it.
Squeeze the garlic bulb pushing the roasted garlic into a small bowl. Or use your fingers to take the soft garlic from the skins. Let the garlic cool completely.
Add the butter, parsley and salt to the cooled roasted garlic.
Use a fork to mash the garlic into the butter and combine all the ingredients thoroughly.
Use immediately or scrape the compound butter onto a piece of non stick parchment paper. Use the paper to form the butter into a log then twist the ends to seal. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours until firm. Slice to serve.
