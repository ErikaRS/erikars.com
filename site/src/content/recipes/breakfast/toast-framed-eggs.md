From Aunt Katheryn

For each serving: Toast a slice of bread. Cut out a round piece from the center of the bread, leaving a space that’s large enough to hold one egg. Eat or save the round piece. Place the toasted bread perimeter on a parchment-lined (or greased) pan. Break an egg into the open space. Moisten bread with a little milk. Dot surface with butter or margarine. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and grated cheddar cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, or until yolk is firm.
