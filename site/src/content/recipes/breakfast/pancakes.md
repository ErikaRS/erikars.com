Laszlo’s recipe from work rules:

Seriously. Pancakes are the easiest thing in the world and quick to make from scratch.

Mix 2 cups of flour,

1 tablespoon each of baking powder and sugar

½ teaspoon of salt. (Actually, double the sugar—yum.)

In a new bowl, mix 1 egg and 2 cups of milk.

Then mix it all together but stop stirring while there are still air bubbles and small lumps in the batter. Those bubbles will keep your pancakes light and fluffy, and the lumps will cook out. You’ll want to stir more. Don’t. Trust me.

Mix in some blueberries or banana slices if you wish, and make sure they get coated in batter as well.

Cook them in a hot pan with butter. It’s just as fast as a premade mix or restaurant, but far, far tastier! This is my own recipe, but it is based on recipes by Mark Bittman and Alton Brown.
