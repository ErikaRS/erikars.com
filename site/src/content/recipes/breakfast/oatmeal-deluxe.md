Whole grain oats, crisp and sweet apples and fresh eggs with just a little bit of bacon will make for a powerhouse meal!

**Serves:** 1-2

**Cooking Time:** 20 min

**Source:** A share at work

**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups prepared steel cut oats
- 1 crisp and sweet apple, small diced (recommend honeycrisp)
- 2 whole eggs
- 2 pieces of bacon, small diced
- 2 tsp cooking oil of choice

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare the steel cut oats to your liking.
2. While the oats are cooking, add the diced bacon to a non-stick pan or well seasoned cast iron pan and cook on medium high heat until the bacon is done to your liking. I recommend a slightly “chewy” bacon for this but crispy is fine too!
3. When the bacon is done use a slotted spoon to take the bacon pieces out of the pan while leaving the bacon fat.
4. Keep the pan on medium high and add the diced apples into the pan. Cook these while stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes until they begin to soften but are not mushy.

Take the apples out of the pan and add them to whatever container you are holding the bacon in. This will all get mixed together in the end.

5. Wipe out the pan you cooked the bacon and apples in and return to medium high heat. Add the cooking oil to the pan after it is preheated and cook the eggs to your liking.
6. Mix the bacon/apple mixture into the oatmeal and divide into two bowls or one big bowl for a heartier meal. Add the eggs to the top and Bon Appetit!

**Pro tip** – make the oats a day or two before and simply reheat them while cooking the bacon/apple mixture.
