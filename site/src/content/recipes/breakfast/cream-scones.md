### Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 Tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups to 1 1/2 half cups heavy cream

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

2. In a bowl mix together:

– 2 cups flour

– 1/3 cup sugar

– 1 Tablespoon baking powder

– 1/2 teaspoon salt

Then add 1 1/4 cups to 1 1/2 half cups heavy cream, stirring just until “a shaggy dough forms,” adding more cream if the dough seems too dry.

3. Scoop the dough into scone-shaped mounds and place them on a cookie sheet 2 inches apart; brush each scone with more cream (I sprinkled with extra sugar) and bake until golden for about 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.
