title: Old Fashioned Hot Buttered Rum
---

### Ingredients

- 1 c sugar
- 1 c brown sugar
- 1 c butter
- 2 c vanilla ice cream
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp allspice
- rum or applejuice
- water

### Instructions

1. Combine sugar, brown sugar, spices and butter in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted (6-8 min).

2. Combine cooked mixture with ice-cream in a large mixing bowl, and beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often until smooth (1-2 min). Store refrigerated up to 2 weeks or frozen up to one month.

3. For each serving, fill one-quarter of a mug with mixture, add one ounce rum and three-quarters of a cup of boiling water. Sprinkle with nutmeg.

### Notes

It is the best hot buttered rum mix that I’ve had. Definitely delicious! It doesn’t freeze solid, and is easier to use when “frozen” than when it’s just refrigerated.
