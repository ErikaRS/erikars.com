**Servings:** 2 dozen cakeballs

**Category:** Dessert

**Source:** Jeff

### Ingredients

- One-layer 9-inch cake (about 1-1.5c of flour)
- 4oz cream cheese w/ a bit of powdered sugar for frosting
- 10-12oz of chocolate, melted with paramount crystals/baking crystals to thin it

### Instructions

Bake cake, let cool. Crumble and mix with frosting until it can clump, but is not sticky. Form into balls (probably 2-3 tbsp of mixture; about equivalent to a decent-sized cookie’s worth of dough), place on wax paper, and refrigerate for 20-60 minutes. Melt chocolate with paramount crystals to thin it. Drop each ball in, roll around with one or two forks to cover in chocolate, then put back on wax paper, and back in fridge until chocolate has hardened, 20+ minutes.
