**Category:** Desserts, Sweets

### Ingredients

- 1 c. butter, (2 sticks)
- 2 c. sugar
- 2 eggs
- 3 tsp. vanilla
- 3 c. flour
- 1 c. cocoa, unsweetened
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 12 oz. chocolate chip, (toping)
- 1 c. condensed milk (sweetened), (topping)
- 1/2 tsp. salt, (topping)
- 80 marachino cherries, 80-90 (topping)
- 1 tbsp cherry juice, from jar (topping)

### Instructions

In large bowl, cream butter, sugar, eggs & vanilla until light & fluffy. Add rest of dry ingredients. Blend at low speed until dough forms (about 1 minute). Dough will be stiff.

Shape dough into one inch balls, placing two inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Using a rounded measuring spoon, make an indentation on each ball, deep enough to hold the cherry. Put a whole marachino cherry into each cookie indentation.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Don’t put the cookies in yet…

In a small heavy saucepan over low heat (or double boiler), melt chocolate chips in the condensed milk. Stir constantly. Remove from heat when all chips are melted, add salt and cherry juice. Stir ’til smooth, and use at once. Spread 1/2 tsp. of topping over each cherry until it is sealed to the cookie. Move fast, since the topping will harden up. Cover all cookies on the sheets before baking.

Bake cookies 8-10 minutes or until slightly puffy. Store covered tightly, and layer with baking or wax paper so cookies won’t stick together.
