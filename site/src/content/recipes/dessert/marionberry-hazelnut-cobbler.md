Ingredients (Serves 6–8)

**Prepare filling**  
In a mixing bowl, toss:

- 4 cups fresh or frozen marionberries (or substitute blackberries)
- ½ cup sugar (adjust to berry sweetness)
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Spread evenly in a buttered 9×9 baking dish.

**Make topping**  
In a separate bowl, whisk together:

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup toasted hazelnuts, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp sea salt

With fingertips or a pastry cutter, cut in until mixture is crumbly:

- 6 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cubed

Stir in until just combined

- ¾ cup buttermilk (or plant-based milk + 1 tsp vinegar)

**Assemble**  
Drop spoonfuls of the dough over the berry mixture, leaving some gaps for bubbling fruit.

**Bake**  
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 35–40 minutes, until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling.

**Serve**  
Spoon into bowls and serve warm, ideally with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream or a dollop of fresh whipped cream.
