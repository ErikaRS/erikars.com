Makes 16-20 meatballs

### Ingredients

**Meatballs**

- 500g beef mince
- 250g pork mince
- 1 onion finely chopped
- 1 clove of garlic (crushed or minced)
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
- 5 tablespoons of whole milk
- salt and pepper to taste

**Iconic Swedish cream sauce**

- dash of oil
- 40g butter
- 40g plain flour
- 150ml vegetable stock
- 150ml beef stock
- 150ml thick double cream
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

### Instructions

**Meatballs**

- Combine the beef and pork
- Add onion, garlic, bread crumbs and egg. Gently mix to combine.
- Add milk, salt and pepper and mix to combine.
- Shape the mixture into 2-inch balls.
- Cover and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 45 minutes.
- When ready to cook the meatballs, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
- In an ovenproof large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering.
- Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the meatballs and cook until browned on the outside, about 8 minutes.
- Transfer the browned meatballs to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs.
- Return the meatballs to the skillet and pour the sauce over (see below)
- Cover the skillet with a lid or foil, and transfer the skillet to the oven.
- Bake for 30 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.

**Sauce**

- Just before frying the meatballs, melt the butter.
- Add the flour and stir it into the butter until a roux forms, continue to cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
- Slowly add the broth, stirring until just combined.
- Add the cream, soy sauce and mustard and stir to combine.
- Bring to simmer, then turn the heat to low; let the sauce thicken, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Remove from the heat, cover and set aside.
