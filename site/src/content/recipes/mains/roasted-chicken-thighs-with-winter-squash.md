### Ingredients

- ½ lemon, ends trimmed, halved lengthwise, seeds removed, and thinly sliced crosswise into wedges
- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 and 1/2 pounds)
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chopped sage
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons coriander seed
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- Large pinch chile powder
- 1 delicata or acorn squash (1 and 1/4 pounds), seeded and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings
- ¼ cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light-green parts

### Instructions

1. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil; drop in lemon slices and cook for two minutes. Drain well.
2. In a large bowl, toss chicken with lemon slices, 1 tablespoon oil, sage, coriander, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Let stand 30 minutes.
3. Heat oven to 425 degrees.
4. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine syrup, butter, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and chile powder. Simmer for 3 minutes. Toss mixture with squash.
5. Spread squash in a 9-by-13-inch pan or on a large rimmed baking sheet. Nestle chicken and lemon on top of squash. Roast for 15 minutes. In a small bowl, toss scallions and remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Scatter over chicken and squash; keep roasting until chicken is no longer pink, about 20 minutes more.
