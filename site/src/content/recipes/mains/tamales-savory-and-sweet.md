## Savory Tamales

### Tips

For a rich flavor you can use lard or a savory broth for your masa. Simmer cooked protein in a red or green sauce before adding to the tamales. Roast Anaheim chiles and slice lengthwise for a vegetarian filling.

### Ingredients

- 4 corn husks (pre-soak in warm water for 15 min)
- 6 pieces of parchment paper
- 8 oz maseca
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp shortening
- 1/4 cup broth or water (I needed a lot more)
- 4 oz protein (your choice, cooked stewed and chopped or shredded)
- 4 pieces of butchers twine

### Preparation

1. **Mix dry ingredients.** In a stand mixer, mix maseca with baking powder. Add shortening and mix well.
2. **Add broth.** Slowly add broth by the tablespoon until masa is blended by not runny. (About like pie crust dough.)
3. **Spread masa on corn husk.** Take one pre-soaked corn husk into the palm of your hand. With a spoon spread masa into the center of corn husk but not too close to the edge.
4. **Add filling.** Scoop 1 tablespoon of filling of your choice into the center of corn hus. Fold corn husk (and masa) over to cover.
5. **Wrap in parchment.** Place tamale in the center of the parchment square and secure the ends with butcher’s twine.
6. **Steam.** Place tamales in a vegetable steamer inside of a pot of simmering water. Cover and let steam for 1 hour.
