---

### Ingredients

- 4 Swiss chard leaves with stems
- 4 1/2-inch thick slices of mozzarella cheese, about 4″x2″
- 4 tomato slices
- 4 large basil leaves

### Instructions

1. Blanch chard in boiling water for 3-4 min, or until stems are pliable

2. Lay a chard leaf on the cutting board, and carefully cut out as much stem as possible. Reserve stem.

3. Lay a piece of cheese on the leave and top with a tomato slice and a basil leaf

4. Fold the leaf around the cheese, tomato, and basil to make a packet.

5. Using the chard stem, tie the packet shut. (If the stems are too short or not pliable enough, use kitchen twine soaked in water.)

6. Repeat for remaining leaves.

7. Brush packets with olive oil and minced garlic

8. Grill at medium heat for 10-15 minutes. Let rest for five minutes. Serves 4.
