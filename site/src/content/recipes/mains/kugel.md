### Ingredients

- 12 oz. egg noodles (wide)
- 2 tbs. butter
- 4 eggs
- 3/4 c. sour cream
- 2 c. cottage cheese
- 2 tsp. salt
- 2 tbs. sugar
- dash cinamon
- to taste raisins, (optional)
- to taste nuts, chopped, (optional)

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F.

Cook egg noodles. Melt butter into hot noodles. Mix in rest of ingredients. Pour into greased 9×13 pan (dot with butter if desired – I don’t – in fact I usually cut the butter a bit). Bake 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees.
