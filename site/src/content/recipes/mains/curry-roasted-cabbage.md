This is a great, low-fuss recipe that uses cabbage, garlic, and cilantro from this week’s share. The recipe calls for grape tomatoes, but I’ve made it with fresh cherry tomatoes, dried cherry tomatoes, and canned tomatoes - all with delicious success, so use whatever you have. If you use canned tomatoes, include their liquid and omit the liquid from the chickpeas. If you enjoy dairy, this is really nice with plain yogurt on top. It makes great leftovers too!

### INGREDIENTS
- 7 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon curry powder, divided
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 head green cabbage (2 pounds)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, undrained
- 10 ounces grape tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

### PREPARATION

Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Combine 1/4 cup oil, 2 teaspoon curry powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Halve cabbage through the core and cut each half into 4 approximately 2-inch wide wedges, leaving the core intact (you will have 8 wedges).
Arrange cabbage wedges in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet, then brush cabbage all over with oil mixture. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast for 10 minutes. Remove foil and drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil evenly over wedges. Return cabbage to the oven and roast uncovered, until cabbage is tender and the sides touching the sheet are well browned, 12-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, ginger and remaining 1 teaspoon curry powder and cook, mashing mixture into skillet, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chickpeas and their liquid and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until tomatoes begin to break down and mixture has thickened slightly, 7 to 9 minutes.
Divide cabbage among individual plates and spoon chickpea mixture over top. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
