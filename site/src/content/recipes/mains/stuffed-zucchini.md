I know that we are getting to the point in the season where summer squash is no longer exciting…perhaps you’re thinking about sharing it with your neighbor, or leaving it at the farm for another CSA member to take home. I once heard that August is the only time people in the countryside of Maryland lock their cars, because if they don’t someone will surely leave a bag of summer squash on their front seat. A bit of a stretch, I’ll admit, but there’s some truth in there. Here's a fun recipe that will hopefully have you looking at zucchini a little bit differently.

*Yield: 6-8 servings*

### INGREDIENTS
- 3 large (12- to 14-ounce) or 4 medium (10- to 12-ounce) zucchini
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
- 1 pound sweet Italian pork or chicken sausage, casings removed
- 1 ½ cups chopped yellow onion (from 1 medium onion)
- 1 - 1 ½ large tomatoes
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- ½ cup fresh basil leaves, chopped, plus more for serving
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- ⅔ cup bread crumbs, divided
- ⅔ cup grated Parmesan, divided

### PREPARATION

Heat the oven to 425 degrees and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the seeds, then scoop out some of the zucchini flesh, leaving a ¼-inch border around the edges of each half. Arrange the zucchini halves in a single layer on the prepared pan and set aside. Roughly chop the zucchini flesh, then place in a paper towel or dish towel and squeeze to remove as much water as you can. Set aside.
In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil over medium. Add the sausage and cook, crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a plate.
Add the onion and cook over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. (If the pan looks dry at any point, add a splash of olive oil.) Add the reserved zucchini flesh, the tomatoes, garlic, red pepper and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes have released their juices and most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the red wine vinegar and cook for 1 minute, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Return the sausage to the pan and add the basil. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until incorporated. Set sausage mixture aside to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, drizzle the zucchini halves all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Add ⅓ cup bread crumbs and ⅓ cup Parmesan to the sausage mixture and stir. Spoon into the zucchini halves, heaping the filling if necessary.
In a small bowl, combine the remaining bread crumbs and Parmesan with 1 tablespoon olive oil, tossing to coat. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly over the stuffed zucchini.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the bread crumbs are golden brown and the filling is bubbling at the edges. If the breadcrumbs begin browning too much, tent loosely with foil. Cool for at least 10 minutes, then sprinkle with more basil and serve.
