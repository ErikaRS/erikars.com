### Ingredients

- 4 pork chops
- 1 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried sage
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 c. regular white rice
- 14 fl oz chicken broth
- Water: so chicken broth + water = 2.25 cups
- 2 small apples (cooking apples – I like granny smiths. and big ones are probably ok)
- 2 tbs. brown sugar
- 2 tbs. butter or marg
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon

### Instructions

Season the pork chops with salt, pepper, and sage. Brown pork chops in a skillet with margarine or butter.

Set pork chops aside. Add a bit more butter, add rice and cook until rice is golden, stirring frequently. After rice is brown, add the water, broth, and salt to taste, and heat until boiling. Add one apple, chopped (uh, remove the core first – skin on is ok with me). Spoon the rice/water/apple mixture into a baking dish, put chops on top, cover, and bake in a 350-deg oven for 30 min.

Melt the butter in a skillet, stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon – mix until uniform. Slice the 2nd apple, add it into the

butter/sugar/cin mix, stir until apple slices are coated.

Remove baking dish from oven, remove lid. Add the apple slices (and drizzle remaining butter/sugar/cin mix over top of chops). Bake, uncovered another 20-30 minutes.

### Notes

Note: you may add chopped onions, brown them with the rice. Also, this is an old-style recipe – newer recipes wouldn’t suggest removing browned pork chops from the heat for safety reasons, but I don’t know what the safer alternative is and I’ve never had a problem.
