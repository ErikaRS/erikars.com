### INGREDIENTS
- 2 large leeks
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1-2 T butter
- olive oil
- 10 oz dried spaghetti
- 2 oz Parmesan or pecorino cheese, with some reserved to serve
- 1 large egg
- salt and pepper, to taste

### PREPARATION

Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks. Peel and finely slice the garlic and pick the thyme leaves, then place in a large frying pan on medium heat with the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil. Once sizzling, stir in the leeks and 1 2/3 cups of water, then cover and simmer gently over a low heat for 40 minutes, or until sweet and soft, stirring occasionally. Season with sea salt and black pepper.
When the leeks are almost done, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the package instructions, then drain, reserving a cupful of starchy cooking water. Toss the drained pasta into the leek pan, then remove from the heat and wait 2 minutes for the pan to cool slightly while you finely grate the cheese and beat it with the egg (if the pan is too hot, it’ll scramble; get it right and it’ll be smooth, silky and deliciously elegant).
Loosen the egg mixture with a splash of reserved cooking water, then pour over the pasta, tossing vigorously (the egg will cook in the residual heat). Season to absolute perfection. Adjust the consistency with extra cooking water, if needed, and finish with a little stroke of cheese.
