### Ingredients

- Salt
- One 15-ounce container ricotta cheese, preferably whole milk
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 ¼  cups freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper
- ¾ to 1  cup flour
- 3  tablespoons unsalted butter
- 10  or more sage leaves

### Instructions

1. Bring large salted pot of water to boil.
2. Combine ricotta, eggs Parmesan, salt & pepper to taste in a large bowl.
3. Add 1/2 cup flour and stir; add more flour until a sticky dough is formed.
4. Test a spoonful of dough by scooping it and making sure it holds its shape when it’s boiled. Add a bit more flour if it does not.
5. Put butter in a large skillet over medium heat and let brown. Add sage.
6. While sage fries, drop ricotta by mounded tablespoons into the boiling water. Do not overload the pot (batches of ~6 at a time).
7. As gnocchi rises to the surface, remove it with a slotted spoon and brown in the skillet.
8. When all gnocchi are browned, toss in the butter mixture.
9. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve immediately.
