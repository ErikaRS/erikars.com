### Ingredients

- 8oz loaf of seedless Italian bread
- 5 slices bacon
- 1.5c grated Gouda, Gruyere, or Italian fontina cheese
- 1/2c rinsed, chopped, packed spinach or sorrel leaves
- 5 eggs
- 2c milk
- 2Tbsp tomato-based salsa
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Butter the bottom and sides of a 2.5- to 3-quart shallow baking dish (Use a rectangular dish that allows the bread slices to fit snugly in one layer).
2. Trim and discard about 1 inch off of each end of the load of bread and cut it into about 16 slices. If the bread is fresh, dry the slices in a 175-degree oven for about 15 minutes. Arrange the slices in the baking dish, overlapping the edges so the slices fit in the dish.
3. Saute the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes, or until crisp, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels. When it’s cool enough to handle, crumble it into small pieces.
4. Sprinkler the crumbled bacon over the bread slices and top with the cheese and spinach or sorrel.
5. In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, salsa, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture over the layers of bread, bacon, cheese, and spinach. Using a fork, press the bread slices down to soak them in the egg mixture. Let it set for about 15 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
7. Bake the strata, about 35 minutes or just until the custard mixture is firm and lightly browned. Do not overbake, or the custard will be dry. Remove from the oven and serve immediately, cutting into squares.
