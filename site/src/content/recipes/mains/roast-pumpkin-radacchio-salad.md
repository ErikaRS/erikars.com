### INGREDIENTS
- 2 pounds peeled pumpkin, cut into 1½-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/2 small red onion, peeled and finely sliced into half-moons
- Juice of 2 limes
- ⅓ cup pine nuts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon pumpkinseed oil or olive oil (see note)
- 7 to 8 ounces feta cheese, broken into bite-sized pieces
- 1 ½ cups (about 6 ounces) radicchio cut into bite-size pieces

### PREPARATION

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Rub pumpkin with vegetable oil, and arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until just tender all the way through, about 45 minutes. Remove, cool, cover, and refrigerate until needed. (May be done a day ahead.)
In a small bowl, combine onion with lime juice, and steep for 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss pine nuts in a small dry skillet over medium heat until lightly browned; remove from heat, and set aside.
Add olive oil to the onion mixture, and mix well. In a large bowl, combine pumpkin, feta, radicchio, onion mixture and half the pine nuts. Mix everything gently by hand, and turn out onto a large plate or wide shallow bowl. Garnish with remaining pine nuts, and serve.
