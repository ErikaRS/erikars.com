title: Cornbread with roast tomato and corn salsa
---

### Ingredients

- Cornbread (e.g., [this one](https://sites.google.com/s/1EfS55MSoJSWTPOOrTmKHsozHtoKtUyg8/p/0B9zA9p3mqsqCbExESGJDbTY5RjA/edit))
- For roasting
  - ~3lb fresh tomatoes, chopped if large, whole if cherry sized (stems removed)
  - 1/2 head of garlic, cloves separated but still with paper
  - 1 small onion, chopped
  - 2 tbsp balsalmic vinegar
  - 4 tbsp olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 ears corn, husks removed
- 1 small bunch cilantro, chopped
- (optional) leftover beef brisket, cut into chunks
- Sour cream for garnish

1. Prepare the cornbread as instructed

2. Combine the roasting ingredients; place the corn on top. Roast at 400F, removing the corn after 30-40 minutes; leave the rest for a total of 60 minutes.

3. Remove the garlic cloves from the roasting mixture; let cool slightly.

4. Pour the roasting mixture in a large saucepan and reduce to desired consistency.

5. Peel the garlic and add it to the sauce. Smoosh it up a little.

6. After the corn has cooled, cut it from the cob.

7. Turn off the heat on the sauce and mix in the corn, cilantro, and brisket.

8. Server over a slice of fresh cornbread and top with sour cream.

### Notes

This definitely leans toward the sweet side. The cilantro helps to balance it, as does a bit of smoky spice, in our case, from the brisket.

We happened to have brisket on hand, which gave this a nice spicy/smoky flavor. If you don’t have brisket, consider playing around with a mixture of smoked paprika, chipotle chile powder, and liquid smoke, to taste.
