### INGREDIENTS
- 1 winter luxury pumpkin, sliced in half and seeded
- 2 medium russet, white potatoes or sweet potatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp. ginger, minced
- ½ tsp. curry powder
- ¼ tsp. coriander powder
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp. fresh lime juice
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- olive oil

### PREPARATION

Preheat the oven to 400 F.
Place pumpkin halves upside down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake the pumpkins in the preheated oven until the flesh is soft, about 40 minutes.
With a spoon, scrape the flesh from the skin and place in a bowl. Purée using an immersion blender or food processor and set aside.
Put several tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and sauté the onion and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the potato and carrot chunks and pour in the vegetable stock. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the vegetables are very tender.
Mash roughly with a potato masher.
Add the pumpkin purée, all remaining ingredients, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Give everything a good stir.
Puree using an immersion blender or leave as is if you like a chunkier soup.
Let the soup simmer until warm and serve.
