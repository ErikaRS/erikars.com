Preheat the oven to **350°F**.

Season with salt and pepper:

**➜** **5 lb bone-in beef short ribs, cut crosswise into 2" pieces**  

Heat in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat:

**➜** **3 Tbsp vegetable oil**  

Brown the ribs on all sides in two batches (about 8 minutes per batch). Transfer them to a plate, leaving about 3 Tbsp drippings in the pot.

Add to the pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the onions brown:

**➜** **3 medium yellow onions, chopped**  
**➜** **3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped**  
**➜** **2 celery stalks, chopped**  

Stir in and cook 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture is deeply colored:

**➜** **3 Tbsp all-purpose flour**  
**➜** **1 Tbsp tomato paste**  

Deglaze the pot with:

**➜** **1 bottle (750 ml) dry red wine**  

Return the ribs and any accumulated juices to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the wine has reduced by half (about 25 minutes).

Add:

**➜** **10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley**  
**➜** **8 sprigs fresh thyme**  
**➜** **4 sprigs fresh oregano**  
**➜** **2 sprigs fresh rosemary**  
**➜** **2 bay leaves**  
**➜** **1 head garlic, halved crosswise**  

Stir in and bring back to a boil before covering and transferring to the oven:

**➜** **4 cups low-sodium beef stock**  

Cover the pot, transfer it to the preheated 350°F oven, and braise until the ribs are fully tender, 2–2½ hours.

Remove the ribs to a platter. Strain the cooking liquid into a measuring cup, skim the fat, and season. Serve with mashed potatoes and spoon the sauce over the top.
