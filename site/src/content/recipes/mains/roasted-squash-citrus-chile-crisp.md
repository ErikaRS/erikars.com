title: Roasted Winter Squash with Citrus Chile Crisp
---

This is an amazing squash recipe. It has a beautiful balance of heat, dairy and citrus. If you don’t want to make the chile crisp from scratch, you can substitute a store bought version. We love to use KariKari in this - it’s delicious and makes the recipe incredibly simple.

### INGREDIENTS
- 4 pounds winter squash, such as butternut, honey nut, kabocha or red kuri
- ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
- 2 medium shallots, thinly sliced into rings 
- 4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 
- 2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 lemon 
- 1 small orange
- 2 teaspoons honey 
- 2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt

### PREPARATION

Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Cut each squash in half through the root end, then use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Cut each half into 2-inch-thick wedges.
Spread out the squash on a large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with ¼ cup of oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss until well coated. Roast, flipping once, until golden brown and very tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
For the chile crisps: Meanwhile, combine the shallots, garlic and remaining ½ cup olive oil in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the shallots begin to shrivel, crisp and turn golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and sprinkle in the sesame seeds, paprika, crushed red pepper and ½ teaspoon salt. Let cool for 10 minutes.
Using a microplane, zest the entire lemon and half the orange directly into the chile crisp, then stir in the honey. (The chile crisp can be made 5 days ahead without the citrus zest; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir in the zest just before serving.)
Cut the lemon and orange in halves and squeeze the juices into a medium bowl. Add the yogurt, season generously with salt and stir until smooth.
Spread the yogurt on a large platter, arrange the squash on top and drizzle with the chile crisp (or serve it on the side).
