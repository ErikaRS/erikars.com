**Yield:** 4 to 6 servings

## Ingredients

- 2.5lbs baking potatoes
- 4Tbsp butter
- 1c milk (approx)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 large cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- 1.5lbs cooked, chopped lamb (or raw, ground lamb)
- 1Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1/2c homemade or canned beef or chicken stock
- 1Tbsp chopped thyme or sage, or 1tsp dried
- 1Tbsp chopped rosemary leaves, or 1tsp dried
- Dash ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Put the potatoes in a large pot of lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Cook, covered, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well and return the potatoes to the pot.
3. Mash the potatoes with a masher or ricer along with 2Tbsp of the butter and enough milk to make them smooth and fluffy. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
4. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and wilted. (Be careful not to let the garlic brown.) Turn up the heat to medium and add the lamb. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring. (If using raw ground lamb, cook over medium heat, stirring often, for about 10 minutes or until is well browned.) Pour off and discard any fat in the pan.
5. Add the flour and cook, stirring often, for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock, thyme, rosemary, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
6. Transfer the lamb mixture to an oval gratin dish (about 13 inches long). Spread the mashed potatoes over everything. Dot with the remaining 2Tbsp butter (which simply means to break up the butter into several small pieces and distribute it evenly) and bake for 45 minutes or until nicely browned. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
