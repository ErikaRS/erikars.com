title: Cold and Crunchy Green Beans with Garlicky Pistachio Vinaigrette
---

This week’s recipe was shared by a current CSA member. She shared that she likes to add a bit of honey to the dressing as well.

### INGREDIENTS
- 1 pound green beans
- 1 small garlic clove
- 2 lemons
- 1 1/2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup)
- 3/4 cup roasted, salted pistachios
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- freshly ground black pepper and salt, to taste

### PREPARATION

Bring 4 quarts of water and 1/4 cup salt to a boil in a large pot.
Finely chop 3/4 cup pistachios until all the pieces are about the size of a lentil. Trim the ends of the green beans
Once the water boils, stir in the beans and cook until just tender but not limp, about 3-4 minutes.
While the beans cook, fill a large bowl with ice and water. Using a spider strainer or tongs, transfer the cooked beans to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Keep them in the ice bath until completely cool.
Finely grate 1 garlic clove and the zest of 1 lemon into a medium bowl. Juice both lemons and whisk it all to combine.
Slowly stream in olive oil, whisking as you go. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese. Season the dressing with salt and lots of black pepper. Store in the chopped pistachios.
Drain the beans, then transfer them to a clean kitchen towel and pat dry. Add the green beans to the bowl of dressing, tossing well to coat. Taste and add more salt and black pepper if you think it needs it. Serve them up! These are best served very cold, so keep them covered and refrigerated until serving if you’re making them in advance.
