With all the greens at this time of year, I thought a salad dressing recipe would be appropriate. It is a long ingredient list, but it all gets whipped up quickly and the flavor is incredible. The dressing is written to be vegan, but substitute non-vegan ingredients if you desire. It can be kept in a mason jar in the fridge for a week. Enjoy!

### INGREDIENTS
- 6 tbsp plant-based or egg-based mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 1/2 tbsp capers, rinsed
- 2 tsp white wine vinegar
- 2 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 3/4 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp table salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

### PREPARATION

Process mayonnaise, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, capers, vinegar, Worcestershire, garlic, mustard, salt and pepper in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. With blender running, slowly add oil until emulsified. Ideally, refrigerate dressing for at least 20 minutes before using.
