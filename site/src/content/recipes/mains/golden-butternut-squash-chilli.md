### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 onions cut 1/4-inch dice
- 2 tbsp finely chopped garlic
- 2 medium red bell peppers cut 1/2-inch dice
- 3 tbsp chilli powder
- 2 tbsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground allspice
- 1 1/2 tbsp dried oregano
- pinch of red pepper flakes
- 2 cans crushed tomatoes (28 oz each)
- 1/2 c dry red wine
- 2 butternut squash, peeled and cut 1/2-inch dice
- Finely grated zest of one orange
- 2 cans red kidney beans, drained (15 oz each)
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsely

### Instructions

1. Heat olive oil over medium heat in large, heavy pot. Add the onions, garlic, and red bell pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have wilted. Add the chili powder, cumin, allspice, oregano, and red pepper flakes; cook for 1 minute longer, stirring to coat the vegetables well with spices.

2. Add the crushed tomatoes, red wine, diced butternut squash, and orange zest. Bring all the ingredients to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste and adjust seasonings.

3. Add the kidney beans and fold in gently. Cook 10 minutes more. Just before serving, stir in the chopped cilantro and parsley.
