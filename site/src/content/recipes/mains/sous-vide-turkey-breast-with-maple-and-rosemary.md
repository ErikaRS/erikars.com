title: Sous-Vide Turkey Breast with Maple and Rosemary
---

**Yield:** 8 to 10 servings

**Total time:** 3.25 hours, plus marinating

### Ingredients

- 1/4 c maple syrup
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 large rosemary sprigs
- 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- 3 lbs boneless, skinless turkey breast, cut into halves, skin reserved if desired (see note)
- Crisp turkey skin, optional (see note)

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, simmer maple syrup, butter, rosemary, and salt until the butter melts and the maple syrup thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool.

Place the turkey in a large bowl and pour the cooled maple mixture over it, turning to coat pieces with syrup. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Heat sous-vide to 145F degrees. Transfer turkey to sous-vide bags, laying breasts end-to-end so the thin side of one is against the thick side of the other. Discard marinade. Seal and put bags in sous-vide.

Cook until the turkey reaches 145F degrees when checked in the center with a meat thermometer, 2.5-3 hours. Once at temperature, leave in the water for an additional 15 minutes to pasteurize it. Serve immediately with crispy turkey skin if desired, or leave turkey breasts in the water for up to 12 hours total.

Note: If you want to make the crisp turkey skin, ask your butcher to save the skin when you order the breast, or save it when trimming your own breast. Scrape any visible lumps of fat off the skin. Heat over to 325F degrees and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Pat skin dry with paper towels, then spread it out flat on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt, and bake until skin is golden and crisp, anywhere from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours.
