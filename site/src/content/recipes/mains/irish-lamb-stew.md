### Ingredients

- 1/2 lb bacon, thick, diced
- 6 lbs lamb, leg or shoulder, 2″ pieces
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. pepper
- 1/2 c. flour
- 2 garlic clove, finely chopped
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 c. water
- 4 c. stock, beef
- 2 tsp. sugar
- 4 c. carrot, 1″ pieces
- 2 onion, large, sliced
- 3 lbs potato, peeled,1/2″ pieces
- 1 tsp. thyme, dried
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 c. white wine, dry
- parsley, chopped

### Instructions

Using a large frying pan, sauté the bacon. Reserve the fat and the bacon. In a large mixing bowl place the lamb, salt, pepper, and flour. Toss to coat the meat evenly. Reheat the frying pan. In batches, toss the meat in the flour to coat evenly, then brown in the reserved bacon fat. If you run out of fat, use a little oil. Transfer the browned meat to a 10-quart stove top casserole, leaving about 1/4 cup of fat

in the frying pan. Add the garlic and yellow onion to the pan and sauté until the onion begins to color a bit. Deglaze the frying pan with 1/2 cup of water and add the garlic-onion mixture to the casserole, along with the reserved bacon pieces, beef stock, and sugar. Cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours, or until tender. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Check for salt and pepper before serving. Top with the parsley garnish before serving.
