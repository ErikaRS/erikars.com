### INGREDIENTS
- 1 large spaghetti squash
- 1-2 teaspoons olive oil
- sea salt and pepper, to taste

### PREPARATION

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F. Slice ends off the squash, then cut widthwise into rings, making sure the rings are about the same size, around 1½ inches thick.
2. Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds. (I love using a grapefruit spoon for this.)
3. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet and use your hands to coat each ring with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.
4. Bake for 30-40 minutes, flipping rings once about 15 minutes in.
Allow to cool for about 15 minutes, then peel the skin away and separate the strands into long spaghetti noodles using a fork.
