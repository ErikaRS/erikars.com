### Ingredients

- 1 lb pork baby back ribs
- dash garlic powder
- dash seasoning salt
- 1 c. white vinegar
- 1 c. sugar
- 1/2 c. water
- 2 beef boullion cubes
- 7 splashes sesame oil
- 2 dash garlic powder
- 2 dash pepper
- 1 tbs. soy sauce
- 2 tbs. corn starch

### Instructions

Meat: Coat ribs with seasoning salt and garlic powder. Cook ribs at

375F for 40 minutes. Cut ribs and turn on their side. Cook each side for 10 minutes.

Sauce: Combine the corn starch with enough water to form a thick cream. Set aside.

Heat the vinegar, sugar, water, boullion cubes, sesame oil, garlic, pepper, and soy sauce until all are dissolved. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Add the corn starch mixture all at once. Stir

vigourously. Turn heat on low and let simmer until sauce thickens.

If desired, let meat simmer in sauce until tender.
