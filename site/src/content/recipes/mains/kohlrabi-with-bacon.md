#### This is a fun hash-style recipe for a different use of kohlrabi. Many people are often stumped by kohlrabi. It looks like a root vegetable, but, in fact, it’s part of the cabbage family. Its German name translates to “cabbage turnip.” This recipe is adapted from an old Shepherd’s Seeds cookbook and can be served any time of day.

#### **INGREDIENTS**

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon extra virigin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 kohlrabi bulbs, outer rink removed, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 cloves garlic, very finely chopped
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 slices pork or turkey bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 1/2 cup sour cream

1. In a large saute pan, heat the butter and oil over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and cook , stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.
3. Stir in the kohlrabi and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
4. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
5. Add the chicken broth, salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kohlrabi is tender and the broth has been absorbed, 3-4 minutes.
6. Stir in the bacon. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

#### Serve hot, with sour cream on the side.
