You can easily make this recipe vegetarian by removing the meat - substitute your bean of choice instead, or even beans and rice. Optional: add some diced jalapeño or cayenne for a little heat!

### INGREDIENTS
- 2 medium poblano peppers
- 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 medium onion, diced
- 1/2 pound ground beef
- 1 ear corn, cooked and kernels removed
- 1/2 Tbsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup cheddar cheese

### PREPARATION

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Half the poblanos, then arrange them in a single layer on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes while you complete step number 3.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes Add ground beef and sauté until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Add corn, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper.
Remove peppers from oven and carefully spoon the filling into the peppers, then top with cheddar cheese.
Return the peppers to the oven and bake for approximately 15 minutes, until they are bubbly and fragrant.
