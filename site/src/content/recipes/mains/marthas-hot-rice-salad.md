### Ingredients

- Cooked chicken breast, chunked and chilled
- Hard boiled eggs
- Cooked rice, warm
- Salad greens
- Favorite salad dressing
- Cheese (optional)

### Instructions

Make a green salad (with lots of herbs!). Add cheese if desired. Toss chicken with salad and dressing. Add eggs. Serve over hot rice. There’s something about hot rice that makes the flavors better.

Note: For food safety, do not put all the salad and cold chicken on the hot rice, just what you are going to eat at that time.
