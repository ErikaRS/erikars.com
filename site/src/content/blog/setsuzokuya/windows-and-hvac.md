Lots of work on the windows and HVAC system this week. The windows are almost fully installed, as was a majority of the HVAC system.

The windows were only delivered at the end of last week, but by this weekend, they were nearly all installed. The two windows in the dressing room were left out, but that seemed to be because they are using the openings to deliver decking lumber upstairs. The rest of the windows were installed, including [the skylight over the stairs](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-mNcC2RM/0/L/IMG20120225140228-L.jpg) and the [various glass doors](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-9P7zHWH/0/L/IMG20120225135133-L.jpg). Along with the windows, [the rest of the house was wrapped in foam](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-pxt6NHM/0/L/IMG20120225141004-L.jpg).

A lot of work was done on the HVAC system, and the mini-split system looks close to done. All the interior head units were mounted to the wall and [hooked up to refrigerant lines, electrical, and some kind of piping (maybe to handle condensation?)](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-q3Mt3sc/0/L/IMG20120225140006-L.jpg). The exterior units are not installed yet, but [some kind of testing of the system seems to be in-progress](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-shXjWGT/0/L/IMG20120225140719-L.jpg). They are installing other ducting, such as [the fan connections to the HRV system](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-jWcVGPD/0/L/IMG20120225135011-L.jpg) and [the exhaust for the kitchen vent hood](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-n8drvXj/0/L/IMG20120225135040-L.jpg).

The timelapse is not terribly enlightening; you can see the powder room window going in, and later the master bath door.

Next week should see the start of the electrical wiring.
