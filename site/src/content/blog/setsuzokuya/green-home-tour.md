Our house will be participating in the Seattle Green Home Tour this coming weekend! Our in-progress house will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10am-4pm. One or two of the finished houses in the development may be participating, too. We’ll be hanging out there for a while each day, and would be happy to give a tour and talk about anything you’re interested in.

For address and more information, [check out the page about our site](http://www.ecobuilding.org/guild-chapters/seattle/green-home-tour/eastside-tour-sites/bellevue-41st).
