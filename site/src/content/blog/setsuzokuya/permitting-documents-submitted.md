title: Permitting Documents Submitted!
---

We have finally submitted the required documents for getting permits from the city to start construction; the submission process was called ‘Permit Intake’ — yes, there is a process to start the process. We submitted them on the last day of May. The intake process involves initial reviews to make sure our documents are in order and look reasonable. Now they go through the full review process. To encourage green construction, Bellevue has a program which completes permitting within six weeks (the normal process, to our amazement, takes twice as long). As soon as the permits are approved, we can break ground. We should be able to start construction around mid-July.

There’s still plenty to do in the meantime (mostly on Yuval’s plate). We need to get the construction contract signed, agree upon a more detailed budget, draw up a construction schedule, and finalize construction financing. We are close to finalizing the kitchen and bathroom designs from Pedini and will be placing that order near the start of construction. We also want to get a siding scheme finalized soon. Yuval will start sharing the plans with others in charge of specific areas. On area is framing; once that is done, we can order the lumber. Another is mechanical, to get detailed designs for HVAC and hot water supplies.

Submitting the permits was an important milestone and puts us that much closer to starting construction.
