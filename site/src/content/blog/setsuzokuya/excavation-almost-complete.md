title: Excavation (Almost) Complete
---

This past week was all about moving dirt. The majority of our site was excavated, resulting in a big hole in the ground. Some of the dirt was piled at the bottom of the construction zone, some was moved to the lot just up-hill of us, and some of trucked off-site.

Quite a bit of dirt has been removed compared to the ground level:

A bit more action this week on the timelapse (note the back-hoe sinking in to the dirt pile at the end of the day!):

There is maybe one day left on excavation, and then the forms for the foundation will start going in.
