title: Footing Forms Complete
---

This week saw the completion of the forms for the footings. The wood forms were fully laid out and rebar was added, both within the footings, and sticking up to tie the footings to foundation walls. These are capped with orange plastic squares to prevent anyone from injuring themselves on the pointy ends.

Our camera got blown around a bit one evening, so the end of the week is a bit off-kilter. However, most of the work was done before then. The forms were completed by Friday so they could be measured for the amount of concrete needed. The pouring will all happen on Monday, and then the foundation walls will be started shortly after that.
