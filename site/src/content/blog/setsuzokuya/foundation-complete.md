The main parts of the foundation of our house are finally complete. The walls were poured on Wednesday so they had a chance to cure over the Thanksgiving holiday (very clever timing!). On Friday, the forms were stripped.

The bare concrete walls look cleaner and more structured than the forms did. The pillars supporting the garage are also visible in the upper portion.

The camera was much more stable this week, despite the winds and stormy weather we had before Thanksgiving. I think it helped that someone used some of the black tarp to secure the rebar post against a wooden stake.

While the main work of constructing the foundations is complete, they are not yet done. Next on the schedule are hooking up utilities and running them through the foundation, and putting in drains tied to the storm sewer around the footings.
