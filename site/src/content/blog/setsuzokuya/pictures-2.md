We finally got around to setting up a [gallery](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya) for photos of our house. We’ve got just a few for now — some pictures of the land before construction starts.

Back in September when we purchased the land, much of it was a big pile of dirt from the excavation of the neighboring houses.

By February, the dirt had been mostly cleared away as the neighboring foundations were completed and backfilled. This picture shows the main area that our house will be built. It is taken from the east edge, roughly in the driveway. The black fence marks the start of the critical slope where we can’t build; that will be near the edge of the usable section of our backyard; we actually own the land for about the same distance again down the hill.

This is the buildable area, shown from near the edge of the backyard (before the hill starts sloping and becomes wild). The pile of lumber is roughly where our driveway will be.

This picture gives an idea of how long our lot is, and how much it slopes. I’m taking this picture at the south-west corner of our property; Erika (one of the black blobs in the middle) is near where the previous picture was taken. All the area between us is part of our land, but will be left mostly wild. The dirt trail will eventually be cleaned up by the city; hopefully they’ll add in some stairs.

This picture is near the south-east corner of our property, where the street connects. Erika is down near the north-west corner of our backyard (on the right by the tree).

There are a few more pictures of the site. You can [view all the site pictures](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Site/16367), or [view all the galleries for our house](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya), which will be updated as we add some more pictures.
