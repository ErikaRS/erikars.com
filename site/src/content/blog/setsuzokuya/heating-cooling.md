“Can we have multiple heating zones with this setup?”

What far reaching affects this innocent question had! Our original plans for an HVAC system were fairly typical for a new home in the US: single-zone, central-air, powered by an efficient gas furnace with an attachment point for a future air conditioner coil. You can add zones to variants of this system, but it becomes increasingly complicated (and expensive). Yuval suggested that we look at heat pumps.

**What is a heat pump?**

A heat pump uses condensation and evaporation of a refrigerant to heat or cool a space. Air source heat pumps use the air as the energy source/sink. It doesn’t take much to get a feel for how heat pumps can heat a space:

- Evaporating the refrigerant transfers energy from the air into the refrigerant. The loss of energy leaves the air cooler.
- Condensing the refrigerant transfers energy from the refrigerant into the air. The addition of energy leaves the air warmer.

This may make it seem like heat pumps would require the space where the energy is coming from to be warmer than the space where the energy is going to, but this isn’t the case. The heat source only needs to be warm enough to transfer energy to the refrigerant, and the heat sink only needs to be cool enough to accept heat from the refrigerant.

Refrigerators and freezers illustrate this well. They use a small air source heat pump to make cool spaces even cooler by transferring the energy in the fridge into your kitchen (which is, hopefully, much warmer than the fridge or freezer).

For further details, you can read [this article](http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12620) and these not-very-good Wikipedia articles: [Heat Pumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump), [Air Source Heat Pumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_source_heat_pump). And at this point, my facts become an amalgamation of things I have read and things I have learned in conversation — sorry about the lack of citations.

**Some trade-offs**

Heat pumps are fairly rare in the US today. They are more common internationally (the system we are going with is from Mitsubishi), and the systems have been around for a while. They are common enough, and becoming more popular as their efficiency is recognized, that we shouldn’t have problems maintaining our system, but it is a risk.

Heat pumps, at least the ones we are considering, are driven electrically, but run at a much higher efficiency than electric baseboard heat. They are more comparable to an efficient gas furnace, but as the opening question points toward, heat pump systems are easier to configure into zones. Separately-controlled and conditioned zones are often more efficient since you aren’t heating the whole house to the same level, but just the area(s) you are currently using. The Mitsubishi system provides [a number of other efficiency features](http://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/en/consumer/lifestyle-benefits/eco-technology), such as providing a variable amount of conditioning (instead of full-on or full-off), and less heat loss in the small, well-insulated refrigerant lines versus standard ductwork.

Heat pumps require refrigerant, and refrigerants are a negative, as far as the environment is concerned. This is partially mitigated by fact that this is a long lifetime, closed system. Mitsubishi also [uses refrigerant that has a low environmental impact](http://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/en/consumer/lifestyle-benefits/eco-technology).

Some heat pump systems, including the one we are using, are reversible — they can transfer energy in  and act as a heater or transfer energy out and act as an air conditioner. Even though we were not planning on installing an air conditioning unit at construction time, using a system which supports both functions results in a simpler, more cost efficient solution.

| **No ducts! The refrigerant line is hardly larger  than the wiring, and with the wrapping   it’s still ~2″ in diameter** |

Heat pumps have one more really big advantage for a green home: they don’t require ducts. We are going with a fully ductless setup where the refrigerant lines run directly from the exterior units to the distribution units. This allowed us to open up the main floor by removing the need for some interior soffits. The impact on the roof was much more substantial. Because we don’t need to run ducts, our home is now able to support a roof design that provides a significantly higher level of insulation. Since the roof is one of the large energy leakers in a standard home, this will result in a much tighter home. (Sneak preview: this ended up having some unintended consequences in our kitchen.)

**Our system**

We are going with a [Mitsubishi heat pump system](http://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/en/consumer/how-it-works). Two external heat pump units will drive six interior distribution units, for a total of six different zones (one per bedroom, two on the main floor, and one downstairs). We decided not to go with programmable thermostats since they are expensive and the units we are buying support a basic level of programmability — a single day/night cycle — that is good enough for us.

| **Not ugly, but not exactly beautiful** |

This is one of the units (installed over the door of our dressing room). The units are not huge, but they are not small either. Each unit is about the width of a doorway, and about a foot tall and a foot deep. This is fine in the bedrooms and media room, where we were able to put them in fairly out-of-the-way locations (over doorways). However, we were not able to do this in the open living area of the main floor; we put the distribution unit behind the fireplace — okay, but not ideal.

This was actually a bit of a disappointment. We initially planned to do a system that used small ducts on the main floor to move the air from the distribution units to the open space. This is when green politics got involved. We’re going for a [Built Green](http://www.builtgreen.net/) certification on our home — this is a nice-to-have that gives us a verification that our home is green by some external standard and is also good marketing fodder for our builder. To get a Built Greet certification, your heating system must be [Energy Star](http://www.energystar.gov/) approved. However, Energy Star does not handle configurable systems well.

| **The exterior hookup.  The installed unit will only be 3′ x 3′ with a depth of 1′** |

Both the ducted and ductless variants of the Mitsubishi are Energy Star approved. However, what is not approved is having a single exterior unit drive one ducted interior unit and one non-ducted interior unit. Energy Star approval applies only to the exact system that was evaluated. This makes sense — variations could potentially decrease the efficiency of a system. However, approval is binary, and there is no process for getting small variants approved; the variant has to go through the full approval process, and the cost of that is prohibitive for one-offs or all possible combinations. Okay, rant over =)

Overall, we’re happy with the configuration that was installed. We’ll provide an update once we’ve moved in and have experienced how this works in practice!
