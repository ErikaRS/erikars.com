Last week was quiet. The crew completed footing drains and put up some waterproofing on the foundation walls. At the end of the week, they started back-filling the foundation — our camera was moved so that the big pile of dirt could be used to fill in around the foundation.

For now, the camera is up at the top of the site, pointed towards the lower portion. We’ll probably move it to a better position once the dirt-moving is done.

Next week should see a bit more backfill, and then framing will start!
