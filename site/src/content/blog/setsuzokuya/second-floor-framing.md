title: Second Floor Framing
---

Framing continued apace, with the majority of the second level finished. Framing on the roof was started, and the main structure is now visible.

With the second floor in-place, the extra supports on the main floor have been cleared out. We captured a panorama of nearly the entire floor.

The video shows one of the upper walls literally popping into place. We had a chance to observe the framers put up the north wall upstairs. They build the entire wall flat, including the plywood sheathing, and then use jacks that attach to a beam (I think a 2×4) to lever the wall into place. Then it is quickly given a few nails on either end to keep it standing while they get everything squared away with sledgehammers (probably a rubber head). The majority of the framing has been done by just three guys (I’m assuming there were a few extra helping to deliver the largest beams).

Next week should see more framing. The garage is the main thing we we’re excited to see next, but it might be slightly delayed due to some changes to the roof connecting the garage side entry to the main house entry.
