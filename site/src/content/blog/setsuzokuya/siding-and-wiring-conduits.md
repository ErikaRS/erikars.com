Last week mostly saw work on the exterior siding for the house. The electrician came by for just a bit to work on some of the last details. However, a few more questions came up, so the electrical work wasn’t quite finished last week.

Quite a bit of the lap siding was installed, including the [north side](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-gpSsbD8/0/L/IMG20120317102407-L.jpg), [upper level on the east side](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-cTj3VcS/0/L/IMG20120317102019-L.jpg), [the north-west side](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-mVrZxB5/0/L/IMG20120317102549-L.jpg), [the upper south-west side](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-PdNjkWK/0/L/IMG20120317102546-L.jpg), and the upper south side.

We acquired the [exterior wall washer light](http://www.elementalled.com/par-64-led-wall-washer.html) we’re going to use on the west side of the house at night. We tested it out one evening after dark, and it should do a good job highlighting our house.

The last major piece of wiring (I believe) was getting conduit for future cabling run. The endpoints are in [the living room](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-FS7mdNf/0/L/IMG20120317101333-L.jpg), kitchen, [office](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-8WTv6n4/0/L/IMG20120317101647-L.jpg), [master dressing](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-phgt63F/0/L/IMG20120317101954-L.jpg), and [second bedrooms](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-W5T73c5/0/L/IMG20120317102144-L.jpg). These run down into [the crawlspace](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-PVhhxgM/0/L/IMG20120317102836-1-L.jpg), except for the office, which runs directly into the server closet. The server closet then has a single conduit that [runs into the crawlspace](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-gPsjFnn/0/L/IMG20120317102938-L.jpg). The media room has a conduit that runs from the closet up to the [projector mount](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-MsF6Z8T/0/L/IMG20120317101803-L.jpg) to send video up there.

I spent some time exploring the crawlspaces under our house. The crawlspace is quite generous, and there are plenty of pipes, ducts, and wires running under there. The space is large enough that we added some stub points for lights. [Under the garage](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-SdZWZ8M/0/L/IMG20120317103021-L.jpg) you can [follow the electrical wiring](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-M9RWtFv/0/L/IMG20120317103039-L.jpg) back to [the central electrical panel](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-tt3wxW6/0/L/IMG20120317103234-L.jpg).

The timelapse shows the siding installation (the work later in the week was covered by a blue tarp to protect from the rain). You can catch a brief glimpse of snow falling Tuesday morning.

Next should see more work on the siding. We are hoping to have the inspections finished up soon; maybe this week if we are lucky.
