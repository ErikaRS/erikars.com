This week was working on the forms for the foundation footings. The footings are the wider, shorter parts of the foundation that sit directly on the ground. Once they are poured and set, the foundation walls will be started.

The forms are looking pretty good. I don’t know if they are quite complete yet, but they look like they are getting close. You can also see some of the rebar being set to make the foundation stronger. They’ll need another survey/inspection to verify everything is right on cue, and then the concrete can be poured.

The beginning of the timelapse video doesn’t show a lot, since it wasn’t able to capture much within the excavation. Part-way through the week it was moved to the top of the pile of dirt beyond the bottom of the house, and the visibility improves quite a bit. It will stay there until the dirt is needed for backfill.

Since it is the end of October, I’ve compiled a sped-up timelapse of the entire month:
