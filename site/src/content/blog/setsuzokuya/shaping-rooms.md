Before we dive into the design of specific rooms, we have one last post on the general layout of the house.

**The Shape of Indoor Space (191)**

- *Problem:* The perfectly crystalline squares and rectangles of ultramodern architecture make no special sense in human or in structural terms. They only express the rigid desires and fantasies which people have when they get too preoccupied with systems and the means of their production.
- *Therefore:* With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a roughly symmetrical vault over each room.

  *In our home:* This pattern took us awhile to understand. The authors start by implying rectangles are bad and end by saying rooms should be roughly rectangular! The key to understanding this pattern lies in the discussion between the *Problem* and the *Therefore*.

  This pattern is all about making rooms feel comfortable. What shape should a room have? The room should be convex. Concave corners feel awkward unless they define a separate space such as an alcove. The room should pack well with other rooms. Unless it’s an exterior room, this almost always means that the corners will be roughly 90 degrees. These two constraints lead to roughly rectangular rooms.

  But why the hate for crystalline squares and rectangles? Rooms should be rough rectangles, but they don’t have to be exact. They don’t have to follow strict proportions (e.g., square, golden ratio) or relate in such a way that a perfect grid could be laid over the floor plan. The rooms should dictate their shapes, not some imposed ideal.

  Our home is made up of rough rectangles, freely arranged and mostly free from non-alcove-defining concave borders. Rooms were sized and placed based on their functionality, not according to any system.

**Corner Doors (196)**

- *Problem:* The success of a room depends to a great extent on the position of the doors. If the doors create a pattern of movement which destroys the places in the room, the room will never allow people to be comfortable.
- *Therefore:* Except in very large rooms, a door only rarely makes sense in the middle of a wall. It does in an entrance room, for instance, because this room gets its character essentially from the door, but in most rooms, especially small ones, put the doors as near the corners of the room as possible. If the room has two doors, and people move through it, keep both doors at one end of the room.
- *In our home:* We don’t have a lot of doors in our home, but their placement in the room generally makes sense functionally — mostly in corners and, when not, placed in a way that makes sense for the individual rooms. Instead of highlighting all of our doors — you should be able to find them yourself from the floor plan ([main](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jcir5Is3EVs/UAIOgApwLbI/AAAAAAAAKRk/jeTpEHpvNZY/s640/Windows-main.jpg), [upper](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cf_tpnA6muA/UAIOgSJMTgI/AAAAAAAAKRs/_tWQLw_Zogc/s640/Windows-upper.jpg)) — we want to focus on a particular room where, guided by this pattern, we moved a door to make the room much more effective.Our dressing room is fairly small space (roughly 10′ x 12′) that has three doors. Placing the doors without creating dead, unusable spaces proved to be something of a challenge. The architect had originally placed the doors as pictured below on the left. This turned most of the south wall (the lower wall, in this image) into a pathway and made the south east corner difficult to use. We ended up losing about half the room to pathways.

  After framing (but, thankfully, before much else was in), we realized how awkward this would be. We modeled the room in [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/) and tried different door placements. It quickly became clear that the placement in the image on the right is much more usable. The path still divides the room — this is inescapable given the placement of the rooms, but it divides the room into two areas large enough to be useful. The area in the lower right, which is along interior walls, will be our dressing corner (the large brown boxes are shelving). The area in the upper left, which is near the windows, will be a sitting area. There is a bit of an awkward corner in the upper right, but it fits my dresser perfectly.

  As this example illustrates, the door placement can make a huge difference in the usability of a room.
