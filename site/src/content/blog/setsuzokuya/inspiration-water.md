Water, always changing, has a beauty and energy that fixed elements rarely duplicate. When the sky is bright and clear, it will match. Under clouds it looks dim and grey. At night, it can disappear. Gazing through clear water gives a strong sense of depth.

Lit at night, water takes on the color of its container and the light. It distributes the light and color, creating a plane of light in the dark. The difference between day and night can be dramatic.

Still water reflects the surroundings like an imperfect mirror. In the dim evening light, it may be difficult to tell which image is reflection and which is reality.

Still water can look like a sheet of glass. A pathway that crosses water focuses your care and attention on the water and the process of entering.

Flowing water provides an ever-changing appearance. It is a natural, shifting piece that catches the eye and ear with pleasant noise.
