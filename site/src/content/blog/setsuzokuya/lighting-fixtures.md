Once we finished the [lighting design](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2012/10/lighting-design.html), it was time to pick fixtures. Light fixtures come in all styles and at all price points. They range from your everyday light bulb to [pendants which cost thousands](http://www.ylighting.com/boc-14-36-rd.html). They range from [traditional](http://www.potterybarn.com/products/armonk-six-arm-chandelier-bronze/?pkey=cchandeliers) to [ultra modern](http://www.ylighting.com/terzani-etoile-suspension.html). The choices are overwhelming and, since fixtures are largely a matter of taste, our builder was able to provide less guidance than for other choices.

Fortunately, we didn’t have to pick out each of the approximately 100 built-in lights in our home. The majority of the lights fit into categories, and the category requires only a single choice.

Yuval recommended LEDs for our basic can lights. LEDs are expensive compared to other bulb types, but Home Depot offers a reasonably-priced [LED can light](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202240932/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053) that uses Cree LEDs. These are some of the best currently available. They provide light at 2700K (a warm white, similar to incandescent bulbs), they are instant on, dimmable, low power, and have a long lifespan (listed at around 50,000 hours).

CFLs, the other obvious low power light option, have similar light quality, but they take a while to warm up, are not dimmable, and have a lifespan closer to 10,000 hours. Despite the higher price, LEDs won out due to instant-on and a long lifespan (not having to change lights in our 10′ ceilings will be nice).

Yuval made a [number](http://www.ylighting.com/lum-awl-18.html) [of](http://www.ylighting.com/fab-d52g05.html) [suggestions](http://www.ylighting.com/lum-awl-13-1.html) for wall scones to go in the stair tower, upstairs landing, and media room. We settled on the third of the linked options because it was a nice balance of style and affordability.

After evaluating the specific recommendations from Yuval and browsing online, we visited a few lighting stores to see fixtures in person. At Home Depot, we spotted a nice brushed steel and glass [track light kit](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/R-202051201/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053) that we liked. Since we had quite a few of these in bedrooms and other rooms, we didn’t want something too expensive; this kit was perfect.

At one of the store, we found an [adjustable arm lamp](http://www.destinationlighting.com/storeitem.jhtml?iid=200096) to use by our bed. We ended up using these same lamps in the master bath over the mirror. We have a fairly thick mirror box built out which would have mostly blocked a standard wall-mount vanity light. The long arms of these lamps allow them to be positioned however we like relative to the mirror. These lamps introduced us to other lights by George Kovacs. We loved a [powder vanity light](http://www.destinationlighting.com/storeitem.jhtml?iid=354114) from this brand, and another offering inspired the [vanity light](http://www.lightinguniverse.com/bathroom-lighting/george-kovacs-p5070-077-pillow-bathroom-light-chrome_g275197.html?isku=2351876&linkloc=cataLogProductItemsImage) in the second bathroom.

Because we are aiming for an energy efficient house, our exterior lights had to be surface mount. Normally the electrical box is set into the house, and the light mounts to that, but any penetration in the wall hurts efficiency. Because of this, we went mostly with the recommendations made by our builder and electrician, including these [lights that mount on the exterior of the wall](http://www.homedepot.com/Lighting-Fans-Outdoor-Lighting-Area-Flood-Lighting-Area-Lighting/h_d1/N-5yc1vZbvnm/R-202765270/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&storeId=10051).

We wanted lights on the upper deck to provide soft illumination near the floor. We originally chose [a small deck light](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017QFZA6), but this didn’t work! Similar to other outdoor lighting, it uses a 12V electrical current. But these lights would be hardwired into our main 120V circuit. So instead we went with [an inset step light](http://www.ylighting.com/wac-lighting-led200-ledme-step-light.html) in brushed nickel.

We have one light whose only purpose is aesthetic. We have a distinctive stair tower and our home is visible from a main boulevard down the hill. This inspired us to highlight the stair tower with light. After looking at a variety of options from [Elemental LED](http://www.elementalled.com/), we chose [this wall washer](http://www.elementalled.com/par-64-led-wall-washer.html), which will be mounted in the backyard, pointed at the stair tower. It’s very bright.

We have three pendants, each of which provides a major focus of it’s location. Before construction started, Yuval found a stock clearance of some [LZF](http://www.lzf-lamps.com/beta/) lamps. We decided the [Gea S](http://www.lzf-lamps.com/beta/products/suspension/gea-s/) looked nice, and purchased a large one in cherry. We originally planned it for the dining room. As work progressed, we realized we wanted a long dining table which would overwhelm the circular lamp. We also realized the lamp would compete visually with the stove hood on the kitchen island. We decided to move the Super Gea pendant to the living room.

After much searching, we stumbled upon this [linear suspension pendant](http://www.ylighting.com/estiluz-blauet-dejavu-pendant.html). We liked the minimal look and thought it would fit well with the linear table and kitchen. However, when we placed an order, it had been discontinued! There was one online store that still seemed to have stock, so we ordered it from them. It was not actually available, but could be specially produced in 9-14 weeks. This was longer than we were comfortable waiting for, so we switched to [an alternative linear suspension](http://www.loftmodern.com/collections/suspension-lamps-1/products/marset-neon-de-luz-short-suspension) lamp that was available sooner.

The remaining pendant is for the top of the stair tower. We were having a hard time finding something we liked that would look good above the stairs. But then Erika stumbled upon [some inspiration](http://www.pickles.no/nordic-light-pendant/). She decided to crochet a spherical lampshade to cover a simple pendant. First she acquired a rice paper lantern-style shade (made of nylon) to provide the shape for the yarn. Then we chose some bulky yarn in a burgundy similar to our bordeaux paint color. Finally I found a simple and cheap pendant that would provide the socket, cord, and ceiling mount. It has a simple attachment mechanism that will allow us to attach the shade to the pendant.

With those and a few other miscellaneous lights, our lighting is complete. We have good general illumination throughout, along with some distinctive lights to define spaces and add our style to the interior.
