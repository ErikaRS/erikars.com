title: Construction Started

After many months of work, we have finally broken ground on our new house! Last week excavation equipment was brought in to start work. The first task was to clear the lot and grade it in preparation for digging space for the foundation.

Up until recently, our lot looked something like this:

But with more cut-down trees and some blackberry and grass growing all around.

When we stopped by last weekend, it looked like this:

All the junk and extra dirt in the main area of the lot has been cleared away. The lines sketched in are roughly were the foundation will be. The first picture in particular shows where the stair tower will jut out at the bottom of the slope.

We also have a timelapse camera set up to record the construction process. Here’s the video of the first few days of work.

As you can see, our camera placement was sub-optimal, and it was nearly buried! We moved it south, so it will hopefully stay out of the way, and get better footage.

Now that construction is under way, we’ll try to provide more regular posts. Every week or so we’ll post a few pictures, a short description of what has happened, and a short timelapse video of the work. We hope you enjoy following along with us.
