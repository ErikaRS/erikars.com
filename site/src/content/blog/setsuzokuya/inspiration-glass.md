Glass is an ubiquitous element in architecture. Every building, no matter what it is made of, uses glass to draw in natural light. Light brings heat, and too many windows will bring too much heat.

Windows provide a view from the interior to the exterior world. They provide connection without being a true portal. You can look, but are still separate.

In these cases, glass is used as an invisible element. It provides protection and separation from the exterior world, while bringing in light and views. From an exterior perspective, they provide breaks in the walls. This adds interest, meaning, and organization to the structure. Similar to water, glass can also change color in different lights, reflecting dark or light spots from among the uniformity of the walls.

Glass can also be used to suspend an element. It is supported, but since you can see through the support, it gives a visual effect of floating.

On a smaller scale, glass can be used directly as a design element. Backed by a painted color, there is an added depth and subtle gloss that direct paint or lacquer doesn’t provide. Glass that isn’t smooth and straight will reflect and refract light to form interesting patterns.

Lighting glass directly can show off the designs in it, or just provide an even glow across a large area. Glass can be used to color, partially dim or obscure, or otherwise change the nature of light that is emitted from a source.

Glass is often used in modern design as technology has improved to allow larger and more fanciful constructions. Glazing technology has also allowed more light transfer with less heat. Modern designs have quickly incorporated large, rectangular panes of glass that fit well with the simple rectilinear lines of the building. Although glass can be overused, the beauty and openness of the material make it an integral part of any home.
