title: Footings Complete
---

As promised, the footings were poured and the forms stripped last week. The actual concrete pour happened quite quickly; based on our automated photos, it looks like it only took about an hour and a half for that. They started stripping the forms off about 24 hours later, and finished that up Wednesday morning. Then it was on to the forms and rebar for the foundation walls.

You can see the progress at the end of the week in this gallery. Not a bad start on the wall forms, and in some places like under the stair tower, you can see the cross-wise rebar going in. I think these pictures really start to show how complex our foundation is. The footings have quite a few levels to them, and then some fairly high walls on top of that. I drove by another construction site recently that was on flat ground. I saw the top of a simple rectangular foundation poking up, and it looked trivial compared to what we’ve got.

Yuval took a great panoramic shot of the foundation forms just before the concrete was poured:

And then a couple (one shown here) of the footings once the forms were stripped:

Finally, the video for the week. Notice how brief the time is during which the concrete pour happens; only a few frames Monday afternoon (Nov. 7th):

Next week should be more work on the foundation wall forms.
