The beginning of October was a bit slow for house design.  We were both sick and had several events during the weekends, so we didn’t get a whole lot done.  What we have been spending time on is collecting a lot of inspiration photos and notes.  We compiled a document with links and photos to things we like, and made some notes about what especially we like in each photo.  If you’re interested, you can [view the document](https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1GvM_C-AOwJjAzfaAUSjgWyVYuWZ0Y9PHqpwhhPaXwUI&hl=en&authkey=CNXVzOsD).

We also have written up a lot of notes about what we liked and didn’t about the initial proposed design, both by ourselves and meeting with Yuval.  Right now we’re working to get the overall layout, sizes, orientations, etc. set; and then go into more and more details of each piece.  Hopefully in the next couple weeks we will have a firmer idea of what the rooms will look like.
