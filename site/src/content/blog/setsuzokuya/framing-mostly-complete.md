title: Framing Mostly Complete
---

We’ve had quite the exciting weather (for Seattle) lately, so I only got a brief look at the house yesterday. Framing looks to be substantially complete. The roof and the rest of the stair tower are sheathed with plywood, the garage is framed, and the rear deck is in progress.

More and more of the work is going to be in the interior, but hopefully there will still be some things to see outside. A day or so was covered up this week due to snow.

The framers are still at work with some blocking and other details. Rough-in plumbing is being worked on this week. Roofing is ready to go as soon as the snow lets up. In general, there is exterior work and interior work happening now. Externally, the house is being wrapped, and it will be sealed once the windows are in (still a few weeks away). Internally, all the rough-in work is being done — plumbing, mechanical (HVAC), and electrical/data. Any blocking for other penetrations (for example, fans) or internal support (for example, shelving, art, etc.) also needs to be completed before the rough-in stage is finished.
