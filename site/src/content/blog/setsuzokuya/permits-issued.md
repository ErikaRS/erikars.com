We finally have city-approved permits for building our house! The last sign-off happened a couple weeks ago, but it took an additional week to finish processing everything and get the permit set ready to issue. If you are curious, you can [view the online history/status of the process by the city](https://transact.mybuildingpermit.com/permitsearch/PermitDetails.aspx?permitnumber=11114706&permitstatus=Issued&parcelnumber=1624059360).

Brent, the project manager, scanned the corrected plans into a PDF and made copies to work from. The official permits must remain on site, but they would get too tattered if they were the working set. The official set is usually kept safe in a box and work is done off the copies.

We should be starting construction shortly. Yuval has started prepping the site (getting a survey, staking the boundaries, and removing trees that will be in the way). Excavation is scheduled to start within a few weeks, maybe even by the end of the month. The last thing we’re working on is getting financing fully approved and closed. Soon we should have regular status updates with pictures of construction!
