For once, I (Erika) am writing a post.

[*A Pattern Language*](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199?ie=UTF8&tag=erikarsdreamw-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969) provides the classic reference for defining the qualities that make buildings work and houses homey. My own sense of what I want from a home developed largely from reading and rereading this book. The book is massive; it contains 253 patterns which can be used to define everything from an entire geographic region to a corner of a room. Such complexity seems overwhelming, but fortunately the authors provide a way to get started. In the words of the book:

> [E]ach part of the environment is given character by the collection of patterns which we choose to build into it. The character of what you build, will be given to it by the language of patterns you use, to generate it.

> For this reason, of course, the ask of choosing a language for your project is fundamental. The pattern language we have given here contains 253 patterns. You can therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably large number of possible different smaller languages, for all the different projects you may choose to do, simply by picking patterns from it.

To generate your own pattern language, *[A Pattern Language](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199?ie=UTF8&tag=erikarsdreamw-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)*, suggests the following steps:

1. First, find the pattern which best describes the overall scope of your project. We chose pattern 76, “House for a small family”
2. Turn to the starting pattern and read it. Add the patterns mentioned at the end and any other interesting patterns mentioned and add them to your list of candidate patterns.
3. Repeat step two until all of the connected patterns have been read.
4. Remove any patterns you aren’t sure about. The list of patterns can easily get too long. We ended up pruning over 30 patterns from our initial list.
5. Add your own materials. If there are things you want to include that aren’t captured by patterns in the book, add them.
6. Change any patterns that you want so that they are appropriate for your situation and desires. Change the name of the pattern so that it captures your changes clearly.

We have gone through all but the last two steps. In a future post, we will  talk more about the patterns that make up our personal pattern language.
