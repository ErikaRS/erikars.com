This was an exciting week, as it saw the start of framing! A little bit of backfill was done at the beginning of the week. After that, framing started strong. They put together a good portion of the lower floor, including the media room and storage/future bathroom. There is also the first of the trusses that will support the main floor.

In the video, you can see how all of that framing work only took three days. The form of the house will be appearing very soon!

Next week the framing will continue.
