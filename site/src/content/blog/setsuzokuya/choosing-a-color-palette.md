title: Choosing a color palette
---

We’re still a bit away from done with the house — about a month further away than we thought (more on that later). However, we’re close enough to done that it’s time to start thinking about a color palette.

Based on our preferences and [some](http://kingaczerska.com/artwork/1049941_Amend.html) [art](http://kingaczerska.com/artwork/1049936_Float.html) we own, our color designer chose some candidate colors for us. Now we need to narrow it down to three or four colors to use for our palette. We have some ideas, but it seemed fun to gather some other opinions. Here are the colors. Let us know in the comments what combinations of three or four colors are your favorites.

Details: the walls are going to mostly be white. The color palette will be used for a few accent walls and for accents in furnishings and accessories.
