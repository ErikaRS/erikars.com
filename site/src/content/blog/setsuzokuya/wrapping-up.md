We’ve now been living in the house for over a year. We’ve hosted holiday parties for family and friends. We have most of the furniture we want, and have rearranged it all to handle our first Christmas tree. We’ve written about the thoughts and design process, the construction process, and the results of living in it. This blog has (nearly) completed its purpose.

We love our house, and it has behaved mostly as we expected. The long and sometimes difficult process was worth it, and we would do it all over again if we had to. A question we often get is: “What would you change if you could do it over?” The only major thing is location. Erika has a longer commute than she would like, and somewhere further north in Bellevue or Kirkland would be more convenient. For the house itself, it might have been nice to build out an extra room on the bottom level during the main construction, as we’re discovering many cases where it would be nice to have. We planned so that it could be built out later, but doing it as part of the main construction would’ve been easier. We also dislike the flat paint on the walls. It mars very easily; while the eggshell paint we have isn’t as fragile and looks good, even with all the light we get.

This is the conclusion of our writings on the house itself. We have a few more posts planned later in the spring or summer on landscaping, which is under construction right now. We hope you found this interesting or useful, and thanks for reading!
