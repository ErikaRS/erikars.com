Way back when we finalized the kitchen design, I wrote a [blog post](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2011/04/appliances.html) about the appliances we had chosen for the kitchen. Well, all but one of those ended up different from what is actually in our kitchen.

The biggest difference was the cooktop. We were originally planning on a gas cooktop with appropriate vent hood for the exhaust fumes from the combustion. During the early parts of construction, [we switched to a heat pump](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2012/04/heating-cooling.html) for our HVAC needs. This allowed a tighter (and therefore more efficient) sealing of the house envelope. When it came to rough-in, however, Yuval realized that this caused problems for the cooktop. In particular, the vent hood we had chosen was too powerful — the air volume it could move at max was much higher than would be replaced by natural leakage and the HRV system of our house. The end result was that we would need to switch to a lower-powered vent hood, add an extra makeup air-exchange unit, or open a window whenever we wanted to use the fan on high.

The less-powerful vent hood seemed the easiest choice, but we weren’t comfortable with that plus the high-powered gas cooktop. We investigated some alternatives, and found that we could get a quality induction cooktop plus lower-powered vent hood for a similar price to the previous configuration. The only trick was that electrical wiring was nearly done, and the cooktop needed a 50-amp circuit. Luckily that fit within our capacity, and the wire was run for the stove. We did end up with an unused gas pipe also run to the island, since that was our original plan.

[Induction cooking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking) is an electric-powered cooking method that combines many of the benefits of gas (quick heat-up and immediate heat adjustment) with the smooth, sealed surface of a ceramic-top stove. We chose [a Thermador induction cooktop](http://www.thermador.com/cooking/cooktops/cit365kb-36-inch-masterpiece-series-induction-cooktop). It has a nice, easy-to-use interface, and an auto-shut-off timer on a per-burner basis. We’ve been very happy with it. We had to replace about half of our cookware, but the result is very impressive. It boils water faster than anything we’ve used before (I estimate it takes about 30 seconds per cup of water to bring to boil). The heat adjustment is instant (a pot of water that is boiling will stop within seconds of adjusting the heat down). It is easy to keep clean (much easier than a gas stove or electric coil stove with lots of parts; and has a lot less of burned-on food than a standard electric ceramic stove). After using it for eight months, we vastly prefer induction over gas and standard electric units.

For the vent hood, we chose the [Zephyr Europa Roma](http://zephyronline.com/products/essentials_europa/roma_island) hood, which is a simple, quiet vent hood with good lighting. It has worked well for us, and looks good in our kitchen.

The [combination microwave and convection oven](http://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/built-in-wall-ovens/microwave-combination-ovens/HBL8750UC.html) from Bosch is the one item that remained the same. We’ve been mostly happy with it. The convection oven works well, and has a lot of nice options. The combination microwave-oven is in reality mostly a microwave, that can also do a little bit of oven functionality. We’ve used the oven function a bit, but it is not as useful as we had hoped. The interface is also a bit awkward for consumers used to modern touch-screen technology — the buttons on the oven are touchy enough that it can be annoying to use.

We ended up switching to a [higher-end fridge](http://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/refrigerators/freestanding-refrigerators/B22CS80SNS.html) from Bosch. It got better reviews, including much nicer LED lighting inside. We have been happy with it so far, although the water filter needs to be changed every 6 months, and isn’t all that cheap.

Partly to take advantage of a rebate on higher-end Bosch appliances, we [significantly upgraded the dishwasher](http://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers/shop-all-dishwashers/SHX7PT55UC.html). We went with this unit primarily because of the silverware tray. Instead of a basket that takes up space in the lower rack, it has a third shelf at the very top that holds each piece of silverware individually. We really like this, especially because it frees up more space on the bottom rack (though there is an optional silverware basket that can be used there). The dishwasher has been fantastic: great cleaning power, and very quiet. We have occasionally mistaken it for rain outside or a shower running upstairs.

Our appliances came from [Frederick’s Appliance](http://www.fredericksappliance.com/) in Redmond. They were very friendly, had all the brands we were looking for, and very reasonable prices. The came in only slightly higher than buying from online stores (which wasn’t even possible for the Thermador cooktop), and offered much more flexibility in delivery. They were also running a special that gave us a free [InSinkErator garbage disposal](http://www.insinkerator.com/en-us/Household-Products/Garbage-Disposers/Evolution/Pages/EvolutionEssential.aspx) which is nicer and more expensive than the one we were planning to buy.

Due to a recommendation from a co-worker, we switched to a washer and dryer from Samsung. We chose a [front-loading washer](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/WF431ABP/XAA) with a nice variety of options and features. Along with [the matching dryer](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/DV431AEP/XAA), we’ve been very happy with these. They do a great job of cleaning, and seem reasonably gentle on clothes. The dryer has a nice auto-dry feature that figures out how long it needs to run to get a load dry. It also has a wrinkle-prevent feature that works very well.

Overall, we ended up upgrading a number of our appliances from the original plan. We are very happy with everything we ended up with, though. The cooktop, dishwasher, and washer and dryer are particularly outstanding. The long-term maintenance and life-span is something we will have to wait and see; but after eight months of regular use, everything is doing very well.
