title: Foam and Hose Bibs
---

This last week saw more progress on the exterior, and a bit of smaller progress inside.

The vapor shield wrapping was finished this week. Since we decided orange wasn’t the color we preferred, they started adding foam panels over the top, giving it a more Mondrian look.

Inside, blocking was added and some framing changes made. This picture shows the blocking in the entry for the bench that will go in.

A bit more work was done on plumbing to bring it near completion. Hose bibs were added around the exterior:

and the [Power-Pipe](http://www.renewability.com/power_pipe/index.html) was installed:

This drains the hot water from the shower, and pushes the cold water up the copper spiral to absorb the heat from the waste water, giving you much more hot water for showers.

The timelapse shows the foam panels going up on the exterior.

The plumbing inspection is scheduled for early this coming week, so that portion should be wrapped up soon. The windows have been shipped, and should be delivered sometime this week. We finalized our HVAC choice, so work on that should start this week, too.
