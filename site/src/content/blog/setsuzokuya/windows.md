title: Windows!
---

We have been working on a number of things in the past month, and we finally have something finalized to report on — windows. Window planning took several rounds of design and feedback, but was relatively easy from our perspective. The initial design was mostly good. We had a few comments, but most of the changes were suggested by Yuval and Markus to accommodate structural changes (a beam was added in the living room, which interfered with some of the windows) or to improve usability or decrease cost.

Our main point of concern was the stair tower. The initial design featured large windows over most of the west wall to take advantage of the views. These ended up being the most expensive windows, and we found the design kind of boring. In the spirit of [Zen Views](http://vasarhelyi.eu/books/A_pattern_language_book/apl134/apl134.htm), we asked for less window and more interest.

Markus came up with a design which really delighted us. Wide windows punctuate the stair landings, where you can pause to take in a wider view. Vertical windows make for a dynamic view — descending from the top floor to the main floor, you see out from the highest point down towards the trees and water; ascending from the bottom floor to the main floor you see up towards the trees and sky. Going the other directions, you just have a small bit of horizontal window at the landing to focus on. From the outside it looks interesting but intentional (plus it reminds us of Tetris pieces, which is awesome).

The original design is on the left, the final design is on the right.

The rest of the windows were straight-forward. We have plenty of openable windows to get good air circulation throughout the house (look for the dotted Vs). The living room has lots of windows on the south and west to take advantage of the view and bring lots of light into the main floor. This is important since the dining room and kitchen do not have any exterior walls of their own to put windows in.

Now that the windows have been finalized, permitting should start shortly. We are working on kitchen design, and choosing appliances and plumbing fixtures (faucets, sinks, toilets, etc.). All the while, we are starting to analyze the budget and make sure our choices stay within it. We have been busy, but we’ll post more as we finalize our choices.
