title: 'Inspiration: Modern Design'
---

This is the first in a series of posts on various sources of inspiration for our design.  We’re going to link to plenty of pictures we have collected over time, and try to explain why they are interesting and what exactly has influenced us about them.  We’re going to start out with an overview of modern design, as that is one of the most general and broad influences, while everything else is more refinements of this.

The homes in Taltree will have a modern design aesthetic. [Modern design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) aims for simplicity of form, with very little ornamentation. Modern design is generally recognized to have originated in the early 20th century, gaining prominence in the mid-20th century. Some of the most well known modern architects were Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Modern design is characterized by clean, straight lines and straightforward designs. Modern homes often have flat or shallow roofs in climates where that is appropriate.  The beauty of the design comes from emphasizing the form or structure of the building.  Materials are chosen to be both useful and beautiful at the same time.

Modern buildings often use large expanses of glass and industrial materials such as steel and concrete. The general availability of these materials coincided with the rise of modernism and greatly influenced the designers. Large panes of glass are used to provide large, uninterrupted windows. Steel (and now aluminum and other metals) can be used for simple window frames, stair and balcony railings, countertops, and other elements. Concrete can be used for floors or whole buildings.

The original modern architecture is considered austere by many. Especially in a home, the use of industrial materials and the lack of ornamentation can make a building feel cold and unwelcoming. Some of this reputation is undeserved. Architects like Wright used wood and other natural materials to introduce warmth into their homes. However, it cannot be denied that modernism also led to some atrocious concrete and steel monstrosities.

In the Pacific Northwest, contemporary modern architecture has embraced the use of natural materials, especially those, such as cedar, that can be found locally. Treated but unpainted woods have good resistance to moisture and sun and can be used for exterior siding. Light-to-medium red-colored woods are often used in the interior — for flooring, siding, railings, etc. Pacific Northwest modern design often uses butterfly roofs (a slight slope inward, so the ‘peak’ of the roof is really the lowest point) and single slope roofs. Both of these designs work well in the northwest where we need to accommodate drainage for the frequent rain but do not need to be able to handle a large dynamic load due to snow.

A well designed modern home is elegant and restrained without being austere. Despite the lack of ornamentation, a well built modern home requires precision and craftsmanship. Modern homes will generally look unique, but not out-of-place. While the aesthetic will not appeal to everyone, we look forward to having a beautiful, unique modern home.
