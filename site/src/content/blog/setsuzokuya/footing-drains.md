title: Footing Drains

This week wasn’t as interesting to observe, but the work was still important. The construction crew added footing drains to keep the foundation dry. In the pictures, you can see the white pipes running alongside the footings. The bit of netting and rocks shows a typical installation above the pipe, and will be extended to the other drains. There is one set of footing drains inside the foundation, just to be extra-sure that the rare case of water flowing sideways under the upper part of the foundation doesn’t cause any problems, either.

For some reason our camera didn’t capture the second half of the week. Since there wasn’t much of interest in that video, I’m only publishing it as part of the November video. The monthly video is very neat, because it shows the foundation work from building the footing forms, up through the completion of the foundation walls.

Next week will be more drains, waterproofing the concrete, and backfill.
