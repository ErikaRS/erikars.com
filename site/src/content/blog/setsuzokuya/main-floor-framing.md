title: Main Floor Framing
---

This week there was a lot of progress on framing. The lower level was finished, and the majority of the main floor was framed. The footings for the back deck were dug out and poured. This was exciting to see. It is the first time we were able to walk around in a full-scale version of the plans we’ve been working on for so long.

I took a few pictures of the in-progress work on Tuesday, and then more pictures over the weekend. I also added descriptions to all the pictures, since it can be confusing trying to figure out what is what when only the framing is in place.

The video only shows part of the work, since the exterior sheathing blocked some of the later work.

This week the crew will start framing the upper floor, with the roof scheduled for a week or so after that.
