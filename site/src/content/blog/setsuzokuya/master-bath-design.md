Last month, we refined the design of the master bathroom. While we had the counter, cabinets, tiles, sinks and other plumbing fixtures picked out, we hadn’t discussed the mirror or light fixtures, nor had we detailed the tile layout or the placement of the glass wall and bench in the shower.

**Vanity**

Yuval proposed an initial design that we mostly liked. It had separate mirrors raised out from the wall, with some open shelving backed by an illuminated panel between the mirrors.

He gave us a second draft which coordinated better with our shower tiles: [FAP Amour Mer](http://www.fapceramiche.com/serie.jsp?serieid=88) accent tiles paired with [FAP Fusion White](http://www.fapceramiche.com/piastrelle-gres-porcellanato-fap/89-Fusion.jsp) tiles. The Fusion White tiles have a subtle gradient texture which makes them more interesting than plain white. Yuval proposed using the Fusion white tiles for the backsplash and all the way up the cabinet wall. This was a big change from the organic pebbles in the original design, but we liked it.

**Shower**

We want a fixed glass partition in the shower so that we don’t have to deal with a door. But which side should have the opening? With the shower head on the west wall, an opening on the east was the natural choice (and would minimize escaping spray). However, the deck door requires a step that would overlap with the shower entrance. It also makes sense to put a shower bench opposite the shower head. To accommodate these constraints, we decided to anchor the shower partition to the east wall and put the opening on the west, by the shower head.

**What’s next?**

This design was enough to get the tiles ordered, and allow lighting to be placed. The rest of the decisions can wait until closer to when they are needed. There is still plenty left to do: finalize the the mirrors and the shelf, choose wood for the bench by the cabinets, choose the treatment for the glass partition, figure out shelving in the shower, and place and choose hooks and towel bars.
