title: Review of Q4 2011

It’s the start of a new year, and the end of the old one. Construction on our house started around the beginning of October 2011, which lines up quite nicely with the yearly quarters. In this post, we’ll summarize the last three months and reflect on what has happened so far.

This was a major quarter for our house. We started construction from just a pile of dirt:

It was dug up:

Then footings and foundation walls were poured:

Framing started with the lower floor:

Continued with the main floor:

And then almost finished with the upper floor and roof:

Here’s a video summary:

We haven’t done a lot of design during the last several months, but we had some good accomplishments. We finalized and ordered the kitchen and bathroom cabinets from Pedini and the windows from Eagle. Our architect redesigned the garage entry (for people) to allow us to stay dry when going from the garage into the house. We changed our HVAC system to one that allows us more control (details in a later post).

This has been a relatively quiet period for us as the owners, but now it’s time to start doing a lot more design work. We’re working on choosing some of the colors on the roof and edges, deciding what concrete is going to be poured in the backyard before landscaping prevents heavy machinery from getting down there, thinking about stairs, the front door, and a lot of the built-ins, and designing all the electrical systems. The next three months will see framing completed, the house wrapped and sealed, and hopefully much of the rough-in completed inside. We’re looking forward to seeing everything happen, and we’ll keep cataloging all the changes.
