title: Lights and a Deck
---

This was another exciting week of work on the house. Electrical was started, including a lot of the lighting layout; and the rooftop deck was framed and finished.

Electrical wiring was started on Monday, and a lot of progress was made. One of the first steps was placing all the can lights so we could approve the positions before they were wired. We’re using [6″ cans](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-wS9wjgs/0/L/IMG20120303111135-L.jpg) in most of the house, and [4″ cans](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-4kbpq8q/0/L/IMG20120303111704-L.jpg) upstairs (they have better sealing than the larger ones, so they won’t lose as much heat through the roof) and in a few places downstairs that we want to highlight. The electrician started placing [mount points for lights such as pendants and sconces](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-zwK4kzt/0/L/IMG20120303105349-L.jpg), [electrical outlet boxes](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-s82qr9T/0/L/IMG20120303105427-L.jpg), [light switch boxes](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-h6wCNwp/0/L/IMG20120303111326-L.jpg), and tying it all to [the central electrical panel](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-36B9Gs6/0/L/IMG20120303105113-L.jpg).

On the exterior, the deck part of our rooftop deck was built this week. The frame for the bench and under-floor was put together earlier in the week, and then the batu planks were put in place at the end of the week. There’s probably still some finishing (sanding, weatherproofing/oil/sealant of some manner), but it already looks really good!

The timelapse video has a few interesting points: first the bench frame above the garage goes up, then the garage window followed by the master dressing windows are installed (the final windows in the house), and then the batu planks on the deck wrap around the bench.

The monthly summary shows the vapor shield and foam being installed, along with the windows and upstairs doors.

More wiring will be happening next week, maybe including [data wiring](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-vNFjkxf/0/L/IMG20120303113151-L.jpg). The fireplace was delivered, and [the space has been prepped](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-2wsbGPw/0/L/IMG20120303105224-L.jpg) for it, so that install should happen soon (it has to be installed before the gas inspection can happen). The [knotty cedar](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-QB8wkRh/0/L/IMG20120303113208-L.jpg) for the exterior roof soffit was delivered. The rest of the siding should be delivered soon.
