title: Roof Form

[As of a couple weeks ago](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2011/02/it-looks-like-house.html), we still needed to decide on a roof form. After looking at different forms from different perspectives and in context of the other houses, we made a decision.

The two shed variants were eliminated fairly quickly — we weren’t as fond of how those looked, either in isolation or with the other houses. The choice was between flat and butterfly. We liked the way the flat roof looked in isolation, but it didn’t fit as well with the community (the rest of the homes have butterfly roofs). We decided to go with a butterfly roof. It matched the other houses and still looked good on ours. It also adds visual interest to the strong horizontal lines on our exterior.

Here’s how the butterfly roof looks in the context of the neighborhood. In the top portion of this image, our house is the right-most one; in the bottom portion, it is the left-most.

We currently have lots of other things in process. Windows are being finalized, kitchen design has started, and plans for permitting are being worked on. It is keeping us busy, but there is nothing finished to report on quite yet.
