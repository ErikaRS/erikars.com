This was an exciting week for work on the house, and a couple new stages are starting.

Plumbing wrapped up this week, but the inspection was delayed due to scheduling and payment issues. There’s plenty of time, though, so a delay on that is not a big deal. The [natural gas pipe in the kitchen](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-cDj7jz8/0/L/IMG20120218130432-L.jpg) was installed. The upstairs bathtub [was filled with water to test for any leaks](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-7Djm8V2/0/L/IMG20120216072422-L.jpg).

Various framing modifications were done this week: the fireplace was lowered to bench height, framing for a soffit was put in over the kitchen (this ended up being just for aesthetics; there is no functional need for it), [the door to the dressing room was moved](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-zTFkfH2/0/L/IMG20120218131158-L.jpg), [the closets in the second bedrooms were shortened to provide desk nooks](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-fmDhdrH/0/L/IMG20120218131303-L.jpg), the entry closet was taken out to prepare for built-ins, and [interior framing against the foundation in the lower part of the house was done](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-ZfxFNsH/0/L/IMG20120218130917-L.jpg). Here’s the interior of the dressing room, showing the corner we have for closet space now:

The exciting rough-in work this week was the mechanical system. We’re getting a mini-split system, a.k.a. a heat pump, a.k.a. a ductless system, which, as one of the names describes, does not use ducts for pushing heated or cooled air around. Instead, it uses [a series of tubes](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-qfKhPzs/0/L/IMG20120218130846-L.jpg). We want to explain this system in detail sometime soon, but the short version is that these tubes carry heat via refrigerant and move it between the interior and exterior of the house — one direction gives you heating inside, the opposite direction gives you cooling. On the inside, we’ll have units in the living room, [the office](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-DgqLBnn/0/L/IMG20120218130712-L.jpg), [the media room](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-SnKf2bd/0/L/IMG20120218130837-L.jpg), [the master dressing room](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-7Vd7547/0/L/IMG20120218131222-L.jpg), and each of the second bedrooms. These all aggregate to two units outside the house:

On Friday morning, our windows were delivered! [A few have already been installed](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-6Kg7Lg9/0/L/IMG20120218130326-L.jpg), and the rest should go in fairly quickly. We can finally see what the [exterior charcoal frame](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-HTfWw8x/0/L/IMG20120218131629-L.jpg) looks like at full scale. We were surprised at [how large the windows are](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-RRXZ43J/0/L/IMG20120218130403-L.jpg). The framed glass panels certainly provide a sense of scale that the rough openings don’t. Also, we have a lot of windows in the living room:

The timelapse is fairly boring this week; the end shows a couple of the master bath windows popping into place.

Most or all of the windows should be installed next week, and the mechanical rough-in should continue. It looks like the next step is to wrap all the tubes with insulation.
