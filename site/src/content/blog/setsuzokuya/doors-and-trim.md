title: Doors and Trim

Doors and trim may not be the sexiest part of a house, but without them a house won’t look finished.

Tall trim is popular now, but we didn’t feel it was the right look for our house. We wanted something minimal. Our trim is about one inch tall and not quite as deep. We debated between a wood finish to match the floor or white painted trim to match the walls. We chose the painted version, partly because it was a bit cheaper.

The electric outlets on the main floor are low and oriented horizontally to continue the clean look. With white paint on all of the doors, trim, and windowsills, the trim pieces almost disappear. The [door handles](http://www.unisonhardware.com/Products/Air-Stream_5) are simple but elegant in a silver metal.  
  
There were some exceptions, of course. Our dramatically dark media and powder rooms called for dark trim and doors. The trim in rooms with tiled floor is also tile. The exterior doors have dark bronzed hardware instead of the silver used inside.

Most of the doors are normal hinged doors, but there are some exceptions. The media room door has weatherstripping to help isolate sound. The toilet closet in the master bath has a pocket door (sliding door in the wall) to keep it compact. We eliminated the pantry door completely to make access easier.

Other than the entry door, which got [a post of its own](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2012/08/front-door.html), we had three doors that we wanted to make more interesting. We wanted to add interest to the main floor and upstairs landing, and we wanted doors that would stay out of the way when they are open (which we expect them to be most of the time). For these locations we chose barn doors — sliding doors mounted on the wall so that they slide in front of it.

Translucent doors allow light through and complement a modern aesthetic. One appealing option was 3form, their [Varia Ecoresin](http://www.3-form.com/materials/varia_ecoresin/) comes in a variety of colors, textures, and patterns from inserted materials. We also considered doors from [The Sliding Door Co.](http://www.slidingdoorco.com/), which has a variety of simpler designs.

Ultimately our favorite option was [frameless frosted glass doors with prominent hardware](http://www.slidingdoorco.com/products/at-home/barn-doors) from the Sliding Door Co. The hardware is a bit industrial-looking but also sleek and modern. Upstairs, we matched the doors to the kids suite and the master suite even though the openings are different widths. The identical doors in different positions (one nearer the stairs and one farther) provide a nice balance.

The sliding doors provide impact in a few key places, while the rest of the doors and trim serve to finish the edges in the house without drawing too much attention. Perhaps more exciting, once you get to trim and doors, you know you’re approaching the finish line!
