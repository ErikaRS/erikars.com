title: Thoughts on the Design Process

Pre-construction work comprises more than design, but design is where we have spent most of time and effort. We are learning as we go, but we started with some useful skills and knowledge.

We came prepared. Erika has read quite a few house design books. We strongly recommend [A Pattern Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195019199/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=erikarsdreamw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0195019199), [Patterns of Home](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156158696X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=erikarsdreamw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=156158696X), and [The Not So Big House](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600851509/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=erikarsdreamw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1600851509). Although we lack practical or professional experience, having basic understanding of what is good and bad in a house (and why) provides benefits: we had an idea of the rooms we wanted, their purposes, and their connections and chose a basic layout pretty quickly.

We know our tastes and needs. For example, we knew that we wanted a particular (and peculiar) layout for the master suite. We knew it would work well for us and were firm about getting it into the design. We don’t always know *exactly* what we want (especially on materials and colors), but once we find something we like, we commit quickly. Jeff’s [inspiration for the upstairs bathrooms](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2011/05/materials-and-colors.html) needed some refinement from Anne (our color designer) and Yuval, but we knew the result fit our tastes. Because of our confidence in our choices, we haven’t wasted time revisiting or regretting the choices we have made.

We are organized. It can be hard to keep all the design tasks straight. Yuval keeps us on track and makes sure we make decisions on schedule. Generally, we work on decisions in advance. We chose appliances well before they were needed which made them easy to integrate into the kitchen design. Months ago, we spent a weekend choosing all the plumbing fixtures because it was fun. Yuval mentioned that we are among the most organized of his clients. Organization helps us make decisions early and lock them quickly. When it comes to process, we feel comfortable that we will be ready for whatever is needed next.

We have similar tastes. We find ourselves attracted to similar colors and materials and designs. When our opinions diverge, we only have one strong opinion (usually…), and can reach a choice that satisfies us both. This streamlines decision making. We don’t agree perfectly on everything. We’ve had debates and even some arguments, but after a discussion of the trade-offs, we nearly always come to a conclusion we are both happy with.

Design has been fun. Being deeply involved in the creation of our own house has increased our appreciation of home design. Most spec-built houses would require many more compromises in taste and value. Our house will feel more comfortable and intimate to us because of how deeply we have invested in it.
