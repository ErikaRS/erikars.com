title: Framing Continues
---

[This is a bit late; the post is talking about the last week of 2011, from Christmas to the New Year.]

Framing continued this week, with various pieces getting some attention. The main floor framing was finished, including the brow above the entry way. The garage floor was framed, with sturdy boards laid down for the floor. Some big beams were delivered to provide the ceiling of the main floor, and support the second floor. This includes a large metal beam that runs over the dining room to the pillar at the stairs.

The upper level had floor enough to walk on, and to see the beginning of the rooms up there. I captured a panorama of what will (roughly) be the view from our bedroom.

There was also a bit of work done on the backyard to level it out, and integrate it with the slope of the neighbor’s lot.

The camera got knocked around a bit this week; plus the holidays resulted in less work than normal.

Below is the full month summary. There were a lot of changes in December! It started out as bare foundation walls, and ended up with most of the main level fully framed. It will be exciting to see what January brings!
