title: Review of Q1 2012

The first quarter of 2012 is over, and it was a quarter of great progress. It was the quarter of rough-in work.

Framing was completed:

Plumbing was added:

Then HVAC:

Fireplace:

And electrical:

Windows were installed:

And then siding:

The timelapse for the quarter shows all the exterior pieces coming together.

We spent a lot of time on design this quarter. Some of it was just-in-time design, such as the electrical and lighting. Framing changes were made based on 3D models of the interior. The [master bath](http://setsuzokuya.blogspot.com/2012/02/master-bath-design.html) won’t be installed for awhile, but the tiles need to be ordered now. There was a steady stream of small decisions, such as the fascia color for the roof trim. Many design discussions are ongoing as we take our high level design ideas and then refine the details as we gather samples, compare colors, and work through every individual piece.

The rough-in work is nearly done, and we are anxiously awaiting insulation and drywall. These will mark the beginning of the finish phase of the project. Each successive stage will appear to move at a slower pace, as more care is taken to perfect the details. Several areas may be in-progress at the same time, though. To accommodate this change, we will replace our weekly summaries with weekly overviews focusing on a single area. We’ll go into details on individual elements, providing more background and design information, plus in-progress and final pictures of the installation. [Our photo gallery](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya) and [timelapse gallery](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Timelapse/18878411_SNG9Gf) will still be updated regularly with each weeks’ progress.
