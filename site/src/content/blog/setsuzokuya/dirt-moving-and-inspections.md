title: Dirt-moving and Inspections
---

Not a lot of interior work was done last week. Rough-in is nearly finished, so time on site was filled by inspections and corrections. Outside, more siding was added, the decks are closer to being finished, and dirt moving for landscaping was started.

More electrical work was done — in theory, but not in practice, the last of it. The electrical panel was labeled, and the [connection to the main service](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Rough-In/i-KjBwsHZ/0/L/IMG20120323183649-L.jpg) is nearly ready to go. We asked for a small correction in the media room, and a larger circuit put in for the kitchen for an electric-powered stove. Temporary circuits need to be added for space heaters to dry out the interior before drywall. This will all happen this week. However, the electrical inspection was approved, along with most other rough-in inspections. Mechanical required a small correction around the fireplace, but everything else that was ready has been approved. The only remaining inspection is for framing, which requires some work from the insulation installer this week.

More siding was installed on last week, including the lower south side, the [north side of the garage](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-4B8svN8/0/L/IMG20120324141333-L.jpg), [paneling around the stair tower door](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-xTg5x3R/0/L/IMG20120324140204-L.jpg), and [some paneling around the living room windows](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Exterior/i-Q9KwCdz/0/L/IMG20120324140304-L.jpg).

Nicer weather provided an opportunity for more progress on the deck. The living room deck [was evened out, sanded](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-Rrf9qPB/0/L/IMG20120324140320-L.jpg), and is now ready for the finishing stain. The upper deck was completely finished, including staining. The [wood has darkened and is a richer color now](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-KHtvZdg/0/L/IMG20120324140614-L.jpg). The finish looks uneven in the picture because it was still drying.

The most important work last week was dirt-moving. The [entry-way was filled in with dirt](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-R4pJd6k/0/L/IMG20120324135301-L.jpg) and can now serve it’s stated purpose of letting people enter. The [driveway was smoothed out](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-rM5x8SM/0/L/IMG20120324134959-L.jpg), so it can now support a concrete truck pouring the slab for the garage floor. The front yard in general has been leveled, and prepped for hardscape and landscape. The [area between our house and the neighbor’s](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-Z58WKKp/0/L/IMG20120324141118-L.jpg) is being prepped for landscaping (which has been designed). Finally, our [backyard has been smoothed](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Landscaping/i-VFG6mpQ/0/L/IMG20120324140212-L.jpg).

The camera wasn’t pointed quite low enough to capture the dirt being moved, but you can see the movement of the excavator. The end of the week shows the finishing work being done on the rooftop deck.

[Poplar has been delivered](http://rice-scherpelz.smugmug.com/Setsuzokuya/Interior-Finish/i-VXhTzX6/0/L/IMG20120323182729-L.jpg) for the windowsills, which will go in soon (before the drywall). Fire breaks (to keep fire from spreading in the walls) need to be put in this week, then the framing inspection can happen. Now that the entry has been filled in with dirt, the entrance through the garage can be sealed up, and a blower can be put on the front door to find and seal any leaks in the envelope of the house.
