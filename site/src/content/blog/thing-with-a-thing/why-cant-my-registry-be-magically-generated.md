Here’s a product idea for anyone looking for one.

There are lots of baby registry guides out there, but I want one that’s a bit smarter. That knows more about me. Baby products are one of those areas where there’s a lot of choice and where some decisions matter much more than others — and a new parent doesn’t know which is which.

I don’t want a registry guide. I want a registry generator. It would take into account baby’s gender (or unstated), how elaborate of a setup you want (bare bones or all the bells and whistles?), general spending criteria (are you trying to spend as little as you can? is money no object? somewhere between?), and some aesthetic guidelines.

Given this, it would generate a base registry with suggested items and quantities, with no more than 3 options per item. You could then use the same criteria to customize specific items — I might generally be cheap, but want a really high quality stroller. The base registry could then be tweaked like a normal registry: items could be added, removed, replaced, quantity updated.

So who’s going to be the wonderful person to tell me this already exists? =)
