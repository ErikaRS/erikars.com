title: Ack! Basic bodily signals are confused
---

As my uterus begins to take up more room and push around my other organs, I’ve noticed that I have to relearn how to reinterpret my basic bodily signals for hunger and urination. It’s not that the signals don’t exist anymore. They’re just different.

Urination I expected. Everyone knows the “pregnant women always feel like they have to urinate” meme. But hunger is more interesting. Because of the compression of my stomach, I always feel somewhat full, which means I have to be much more conscious of what hunger feels like and, when I eat (especially since I can’t eat as much at once) more conscious of what full feels like (the consequence being a stomachache and/or nausea).

I think I’ll figure it out, but it sure is odd.
