Spending time with people before you’re ready to reveal your pregnancy is dangerous, especially when food is involved. During our annual holiday party, one of our good friends, Shawna, started to get suspicious, and the next time we saw each other asked, “Do you and Jeff have a secret?”

Although we weren’t actively telling people about our pregnancy yet, we were letting people know if the subject came up directly. So I told her and decided to tell the rest of the folks who were over for dinner that evening.

This is how I told them:

> Me: “Since Shawna went and spoilered it, I wanted to let you all know that I wasn’t drinking saké tonight.”
>
> :: silence::
>
> Me: Let me try again. Jeff is not a vampire.
>
> Everyone else: “Congratulations!” “+1”

You see, over dinner, we had just been talking about how in some universe or another, when a vampire and human got pregnant, it was always the vampire who carried the child, regardless of gender.

I love my friends.
