| Baby at 14 weeks (too early to tell gender) |

Look! It’s out baby! It looks just like… a generic ultrasound picture.

But still, it’s *our* generic ultrasound picture, and it’s kind of funny how much of a difference that makes. When you know that the video feed you’re seeing corresponds to a little baby’s movement inside of you, it become more than just another grainy black and white image. It becomes the excitement that baby really does have arms and legs and a heart and brain and everything, just like a real baby!

So, hello baby! You look exactly like I imaged you’d look.
