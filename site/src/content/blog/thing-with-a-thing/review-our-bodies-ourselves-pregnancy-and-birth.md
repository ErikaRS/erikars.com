[*Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth*](http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=erikarsdreamw-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=074327486) was the first book about pregnancy I read so, of course, it is going to influence me more than books I read later. That said, it still stands out as a good book on the topic of pregnancy, labor, and the early postpartum period.

I appreciate the balance the authors of this book struck between being clear as to which choices they considered best but still discussing multiple options and the situations under which those alternatives might be best. One example prevalent throughout the book is the preference for vaginal, minimally medicated birth over more heavily medicated or cesarean births. The authors described both why they preferred less medicated vaginal births and discussed the situations under which other options were reasonable or necessary. With this background, I feel more confident in my ability to try to make the right decisions for myself without feeling guilty about not having the “perfect” birth experience.

Another aspect of this book that I liked was the clear focus on empowering and advocating for women. This book did not try to limit itself to just the birth process. The authors were not afraid to discuss policies they considered bad or advocate for change.

One aspect of this book that may be considered a weakness, depending on what you are looking for, is that it focused on breadth more than depth. The authors gave just enough detail to enable you to ask further questions. Thus, while it’s a great first book about pregnancy and birth, those who have read other books with similar scope will likely not encounter as much new material.
