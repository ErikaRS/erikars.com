You may have noticed that the last post didn’t mention baby’s gender. We did choose to find out the gender (verified two ways, in fact), but we’re not telling anyone.

Why? Stereotypes. From pink vs blue to trains vs princesses to selective praise of strength or kindness, even in tiny infants, we start stereotyping children before they are born. Nature vs nurture hardly gets a fair evaluation when almost everything an infant does is perceived through a gendered lens. We can’t stop that, but we can delay it a tiny bit.

Plus, aren’t surprises more exciting? =)
