title: First impressions of parenthood

To close out this blog, I want to share some first impressions of my experience as a mother.

The short answer is that I’m infatuated and tired.

Of course, I don’t have much experience yet — just over seven weeks — and my child isn’t that challenging yet, in the big scheme of things. She eats. She sleeps. She poops. But already, my life has changed to orient around her.

She’s the most wonderful little person in the world. Every movement and every sound is fascinating. Some of them are worrisome or annoying too, but still worthwhile. She’s growing and changing so quickly. She has slowed me down. I am paying attention to the tiniest things and living life on her schedule.

I have a much greater respect for other parents. I’ve always thought parents are doing wonderful work, but as everyone tells you, it’s not until you have a baby that you really know. I really appreciate the advice given and the advice *not* given by other parents I know. It’s been a whole new learning experience.

Of course, not everything is good. She can be fussy — everyone tells us that we’re currently at peak fussiness. Fortunately, bouncing and walking a baby is good exercise (and baby wearing is a life saver). We’re sleep deprived. Recently things have “improved” to where we often get a three hour chunk of sleep. Before that, the longest stretch was 1-1.5 hours.

But overall, our baby is healthy and generally pretty chill. I am excited about my new role as her caretaker, protector, teacher, safe harbor — in short, her mommy.
