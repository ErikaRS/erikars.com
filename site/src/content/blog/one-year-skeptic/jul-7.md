**Old Testament**

More genealogy. The only interesting aspect is how some names seem familiar because they belong to people we have seen before and others seem familiar because they belonged to a different person we have seen before.

**New Testament**

Paul appears before Festus, the governor who succeeds Felix (he was a governor, right?). Festus finally gets around to hearing Paul’s case, but he cannot figure out what the Jews are going on about, so he accepts Paul’s appeal to the emperor. Paul is smart enough to know to stay away from Jerusalem for now.

Before that, Paul will get a chance to talk to King Agrippa (king of what?) so that they can try to figure out what to tell the emperor Paul was accused of.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

I notice that today’s psalm is attributed to David, but it seems like it cannot have actually been by him. In it, the psalmist says,

> I will worship at your Temple with deepest awe.

But, according to the Biblical text, there was no Temple in David’s time.

Today’s proverb is a good one:

> An offended friend is harder to win back than a fortified city.  
> Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with bars.
