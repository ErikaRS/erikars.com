**Old Testament**  
  
Continued predictions of suckage for Babylon, including imagery of Babylon as a golden cup which made the world drunk. Plus a bit about how God is more awesome than idols.

**New Testament**

A description of the way that old men, old women, young women, and young men should live. Plus, more encouraging slaves to submit to their masters.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

> Interfering in someone else’s argument  
> is as foolish as yanking a dog’s ears.
