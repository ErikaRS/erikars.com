**Old Testament**

Today we get a graphic description of Jerusalem and Samaria as two sisters who prostitute themselves even from their youth. Even after God marries them they continue their prostituting ways.

I know this is supposed to be a condemnation of Samaria and Jerusalem, but what does God expect is going to happen if he marries prostitutes?  Sudden reformation?

The upshot of the sin of these sister cities was that both they both earned God’s anger and destruction.

**New Testament**

Today we finally finish (at least for the moment) the discussion of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest. To close this discussion, the author of Hebrews declares that the purification that came from Jesus’ sacrifice allows believers to go into the presence of God.

But the author then goes on to say that anyone who deliberately continues to sin after receiving this purification cannot be saved by any sacrifice. In other words, they are lost to God’s punishment (and, as our OT readings make clear, that sucks). There are no second chances in this view.

Because falling off the wagon is so terrible, the author of Hebrews reminds his readers to keep their trust in the Lord strong.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

I think the upshot of today’s proverb is that you should be cautious with those who make risky financial decisions:

> Get security from someone who guarantees a stranger’s debt.  
> Get a deposit if he does it for foreigners.
