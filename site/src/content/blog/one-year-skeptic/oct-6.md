**Old Testament**

Judah is evil, evil, evil. Amongst their misdeeds: rejection of the Lord, idolatry, insincere religious worship. For this they will be invaded and suffer.

**New Testament**

This is one of those statements which may very well have a sensible interpretation, but can be altogether too easily abused (e.g., to deny evolution or democracy).

> Don’t let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ.

In context, this verse seems to be implying that people should not have their heads turned by the ideas that come from human thinking. They should not follow those ideas if they contradict what they have learned from Paul and/or Jesus. That does not mean that ideas from other humans should be rejected. Anyone who thinks about it for a minute would realize that is silly since the Bible does not even talk about all moral issues, let alone all ideas that are applicable to human well being.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

A good proverb:

> An honest answer  
> is like a kiss of friendship.
