**Old Testament**

Today, I notice that the central point of this author’s narrative is Jerusalem and scattered Jews. Every other message comes back to those. Even the message at the beginning, which compares those who fear the Lord those who go their own way comes back to images of sacrifice, a temple image which clearly brings forth thoughts of Jerusalem.

The other point I notice is more violent, vengeful imagery, but, sadly, I think I am becoming somewhat desensitized to that.

And… that’s the end of Isaiah. Hmph. Rather a flat ending. Actually, to me, the flatness of the ending supports the “collection of prophecies” hypothesis about this book. Isaiah is a collection of prophecies (probably by 3 or more prophets). Because the point was to catalog the historical range of prophecy, there isn’t a clear end.

**New Testament**

Paul points how that he was more Jewish than the Jewest Jew, but now he considers all of those things completely worthless because of his relationship with Jesus. Paul then exhorts the Philippians to model their life after his. He has not achieved perfection, but he is focused on the goal and will get there.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

> Don’t wait in ambush at the home of the godly,  
> and don’t raid the house where the godly live.  
> The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.  
> But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked.

Does anyone else see how you could read this as “Don’t ambush the godly because you’ll fail; instead, ambush the wicked because they’re much easier to beat.”?
