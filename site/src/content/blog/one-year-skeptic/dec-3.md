**Old Testament**

Daniel’s vision, which I have already largely forgotten, is explained (sets of seven and anointed ones, I believe). It’s pretty much all politics. Kingdoms rise, fall, and meet in battle. Eventually there will be some prosecution involved. The details are not particularly interesting.

**New Testament**

A continuation of the discussion on righteousness and sin. The lack of righteous living or loving other believers shows that one does not belong to God. The author of this epistle seems to be carefully implying that having those two traits does not necessarily imply that one does belong to God. He also seems to be adding more weight to my earlier impression that he has watered down Jesus’ command to love others to the much weaker command to love other believers.

The discussion on love which follows further solidifies the author’s view on this point. Compassion and action are set out as necessary features of love.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

I like this proverb:

> Whoever stubbornly refuses to accept criticism  
> will suddenly be destroyed beyond recovery.
