**Old Testament**

Absalom is defeated and dies and then David is very sad. Joab rebukes him for being so depressed over the death of someone who was trying to kill him.

The beginning of Absalom’s death scene is kind of entertaining:

> During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David’s men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair got caught in the tree. His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air. One of David’s men saw what had happened and told Joab, “I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.”

It is especially entertaining because when Absalom was first introduced, his wonderful hair was described. That same wonderful hair became his downfall.

**New Testament**

Another resurrection account. Not particularly consistent with the rest of them, of course.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

We finish up the super long psalm with ר (resh), ש (shin), and ת (taw).
