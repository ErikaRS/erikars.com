**Old Testament**

Today’s reading describes the building of Solomon’s palace as well as some of the furnishings for the temple. It reminds me strongly of the [description of the Tabernacle from Exodus](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2025-31,Exodus%2035-40&version=NLT). Solomon’s palace was a much more complicated structure than the temple and, so got a lot more description. I enjoyed the read, but there’s nothing really to comment on.

I did, however, find great pictures of what the palace and temple metalwork may have looked like… from the [Brick Testament](http://www.thebricktestament.com/) (in particular the sections on [The Temple of Yahweh](http://www.thebricktestament.com/king_solomon/the_temple_of_yahweh/2ch02_01.html) and [Solomon’s Palace](http://www.thebricktestament.com/king_solomon/solomons_palace/1k07_01p11.html)).  I love legos.

**New Testament**

More history review, but now with some commentary. We go from Moses’ vision of God in the burning bush through Solomon’s building of the temple. Here is an excepts that I am guessing makes up part of the build up to Stephen’s point:

> So God sent back the same man his people had previously rejected when they demanded, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?’ Through the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush, God sent Moses to be their ruler and savior. And by means of many wonders and miraculous signs, he led them out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, and through the wilderness for forty years. [Hmmm, rejected ruler who gave miraculous signs, I wonder who could be seen as a contemporary analog of that.]

**Psalms and Proverbs**

> We may throw the dice,  
> but the Lord determines how they fall.

Actually, no, not really.
