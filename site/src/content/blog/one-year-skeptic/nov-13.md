**Old Testament**

Really? Nearly a whole day’s worth of reading continuing yesterday’s already long prophecy again Tyre? Why, oh why?

What did Ezekiel have against Tyre? Given that much of the prophecy describes Tyre’s glory, I am thinking that Ezekiel and/or the exiled people of Judah suffered from jealously of glorious, beautiful, powerful Tyre.

We also read a short prophecy against Sidon and a declaration of Israel’s eventual restoration.

**New Testament**

We continue with the who’s who of Biblical characters, including a rather lengthy recounting of Moses’ acts of faith.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

A quarrelsome wife is annoying and unstoppable.
