*I will send terror ahead of you and create panic among all the people whose lands you invade. I will make all your enemies turn and run. I will send terror ahead of you to drive out the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites.* — Exodus 23:27-28

**Old Testament**

In today’s reading, God tells Moses that he will send an angel to protect the Israelites as they take over the land God promises to them. God promises to oppose all who would thwart the Israelites as long as they obey all his commands.

> For my angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, so you may live there. And I will destroy them completely.

God promises to commit genocide. Lovely. The Israelites agree to this covenant (to seal it, Moses sprinkles blood on them).

Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel climb Mount Sinai and see the God of Israel. God likes to stand around on surfaces that look like “brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself”. Good taste! Lapis lazuli is a favorite of mine.

Throughout the rest of today’s reading, God gives Moses detailed instructions on the design of the Ark of the Covenant, a table, and a lampstand. God likes gold.

**New Testament**

Jesus continues to drone on about the end of the world. We also read Jesus’ claim,

> I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.

The footnote says that generation may be translated as “age” or “nation”. However, if generation was the most likely translation then Jesus was wrong, or he was using “generation” in a very non-standard way.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

According to today’s reading from Psalms, God’s

> anger lasts only a moment,  
> but his favor lasts a lifetime!

But remember, this is only if you are not the Amalekites. God hates them forever.

Today’s reading from Proverbs sounds like it might be an epilogue to the teachings about avoiding immoral women. I sure hope so.
