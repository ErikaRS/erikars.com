**Old Testament**

Today is all anger and destruction. There is not even a single thread of hope. God’s mad and he’s going to punish all whom he thinks deserve it. I don’t really have much more to say. This may be the most concentrated presentation of God’s anger we have seen all year, but it is certainly nothing new.

**New Testament**

Today’s reading makes it clear that although he considered animal blood purifying, he did not consider it capable of taking away sins. I am not quite sure what distinction the author is making between those two (I can guess, but the text does not provide much clue).

In any case, the text continues to hammer on the same point: that Jesus’ blood was adequate where the blood demanded under Mosaic law were not and that Jesus cancelled and replaced the old covenant.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Prudent people prepare for danger. Simpletons don’t.
