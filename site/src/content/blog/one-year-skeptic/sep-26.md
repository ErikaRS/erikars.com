**Old Testament**

Today we have declarations that the God of Israel is the only God, declarations of Cyrus of Persia as the rescuer of Israel, passages that could be interpreted as foretelling a messiah, declarations of Israel’s disobedience, and promises of Israel’s restoration. Nothing new really, so I have nothing interesting to say.

**New Testament**

Today’s readings consist largely of a bunch of common sense moral commandments.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Today’s proverbs are about the value of wisdom, especially in war.

Wow, I don’t have a lot to say today. I guess even I am sometimes concise.
