**Old Testament**

So the people of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were not trying to rebel against God. They were just trying to build a reminder to the people to the west of the Jordan that they too have the right to worship God at the Tabernacle. This was considered a sufficient answer:

> Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened. And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad

Also, I noticed something tricky today. So, Eleazar is the priest and is, therefore, still alive. Furthermore, he has been around for awhile, since he was already a priest [when his brothers were burned to death](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2010:1-11&version=NLT). But didn’t [everyone over 20 at the time of the people’s rebellion die](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2014&version=NLT) (except for Joshua and Caleb). Ah! But wait. The passage from Numbers says:

> Because you complained against me, every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the registration will die.

If we look at the registration we see,

> But as the Lord had commanded, the Levites were not included in this registration.

So it is okay that Eleazar is still alive.

Also, Joshua’s dying. He warns the Israelites to keep themselves separate from those around them or else God will get angry.

**New Testament**

More repetitive exchanges between Jesus and the religious teachers.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

A continuation of yesterday’s psalm: “Yay, yay! God is wonderful, and so is David his chosen king.”
