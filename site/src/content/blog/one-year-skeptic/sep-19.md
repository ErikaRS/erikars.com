**Old Testament**

Today I am struck most by the overall structure of Isaiah, especially in today’s reading. Isaiah alternates between visions of destruction (for Jerusalem, Egypt, Assyria, complacent women, etc.) and visions of the Lord’s reconciliation with his people. Those cycles contrast relying on human strength and God’s strength implying, obviously, that the former brings destruction and the later prosperity.

In the midst of all that we read this,

> The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days in one!

For the record, I think that would very bad.

**New Testament**

Paul says: Circumcision cannot make one right with God. Only faith can. Why in the world are the Galatians believing these lies? They certainly don’t match up with what Paul teaches (despite rumors they may have heard otherwise).

Paul also makes a reference to yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough. Both the kingdom of heaven and the teachings of the Pharisees were compared to yeast in the gospels. I wonder whether Paul got the yeast imagery from the traditions about Jesus he was familiar with or if yeast was just a common analogy at the time. Since the letters of Paul were written before the gospels, if yeast were not a common analogy, we would have reason to suspect that yeast imagery was part of the early tradition surrounding Jesus.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Today’s proverb is about respecting your parents.
