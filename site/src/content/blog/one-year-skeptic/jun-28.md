**Old Testament**

Instead of trying to summarize, I will just link the [chart of kings of Israel and Judah](http://ldolphin.org/kings.html) that [another Bible blogger](http://bibleblog365.blogspot.com/) linked yesterday. The important point (which is to say, the only point I can remember clearly), is that most of the kings have names that start with J. Except for the ones whose names start with A.

I find it kind of odd that King Hazael of Aram named his son after Ben-hadad, the former king of Aram whom Hazael murdered.

We read about Elisha’s final prophecy today. He tells King Jehoash of Israel that he will defeat Aram. Then he has Jehoash beat some arrows against the ground. Jehoash does so three times and only then does Elisha bother to tell him that the number of times that Jehoash struck the ground would indicate how soundly he beat Aram (based on some undisclosed scale). How was Jehoash to know?

After Elisha died, his bone apparently had the power to bring people back to life. Creepy.

**New Testament**

Today we read about Apollos, “an eloquent speaker who knew the Scriptures well.” Apparently,

> He refuted the Jews with powerful arguments in public debate. Using the Scriptures, he explained to them that Jesus was the Messiah.

It is a pity the author of Acts did not seem to think it worthwhile to repeat these wonderful arguments. I am curious to see whether or not they are any less inane than modern apologetics.

The rest of the reading is about Paul’s journeying. We learn that

> God gave Paul the power to perform unusual miracles. When handkerchiefs or aprons that had merely touched his skin were placed on sick people, they were healed of their diseases, and evil spirits were expelled.

Today is the day for miracles transmitted by touch, isn’t it?

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Nothing particularly noteworthy.
