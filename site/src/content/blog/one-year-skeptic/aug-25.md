**Old Testament**

Job’s friends have a point when they accuse him of going on and on. Despite the good points he has to make, he is distinctly more verbose than his friends.

That said, both of Job’s speeches today bring up a key point. Despite the fact that Job’s friends may have some legitimate points, this is not the appropriate time for them. Mercy and sympathy need to come before advice and admonishment are appropriate. Job would not feel so bitter against his companions, I am guessing, if they had not started the conversation as Job’s persecutors.

Bildad’s response to Job shows the increasing distance between the two sides. Job is suffering and asking for sympathy, but all Bildad hears are the accusations against Job just as all Job hears now is the accusations against him.

Bildad does not make any new points in this speech. He continues to hold the position that the wicked will always be punished and are always waiting in fear of that punishment. The wicked will be forgotten with no descendants. Yet, that hopeless fate for the wicked holds no more similarity to reality than it did the first time around.

**New Testament**

We finish 1 Corinthians today. It’s a rather uninteresting listing of administrative instructions and greetings.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

A good proverb:

> Choose a good reputation over great riches;  
> being held in high esteem is better than silver or gold.
