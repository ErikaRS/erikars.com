I have stopped adding pictures to posts because they make the posts take an extra ~10 minutes to write. Do people miss them? Prefer having them gone? I know that I often found them entertaining, and they helped to break up the wall of text, but I do not know if other people appreciate them enough to make the effort worthwhile. (And, since I haven’t included any pictures in awhile, I have included a [random one](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carrots_of_many_colors.jpg) in this post. =)
