**Old Testament**

Gloom and doom. Disloyalty and destruction. God hates everyone in Jerusalem and will destroy them all. Really, nothing particularly noteworthy.

**New Testament**

Believers must continue to stand firm in the truth that Paul taught them. Paul’s God given mission is to preach about Jesus, even if it means he must suffer.

After that we get an interesting bit,

> I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God’s mysterious plan, which is Christ himself.

Now, it may be that “understand” is only an approximation to what Paul is getting at, but I find this statement interesting because so many contemporary Christians claim that no one can understand God’s mysterious plan. Yet here is Paul seemingly saying that the believers should have “complete confidence” that they understand this plan. Curious.

After that, we read a statement of how the believers should continue to deepen their faith and build their lives on Christ.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Judges should be fair.
