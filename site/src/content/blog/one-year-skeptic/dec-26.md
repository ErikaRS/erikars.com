**Old Testament**

Today’s sounding more like good ol’ doom and gloom for the enemies prophecy. One slightly novel bit is this proclamation:

> Then the surviving Philistines will worship our God  
> and become like a clan in Judah.

That is oddly welcoming for a gloom and doom prophecy.

The rest of the reading is a prophecy about Zion’s coming king. This contains the famous poetic parallel which some believe the author of Matthew misinterpreted when he [implied that Jesus rode both a colt and a donkey into Jerusalem](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:1-11&version=NLT):

> Look, your king is coming to you.  
> He is righteous and victorious,  
> yet he is humble, riding on a donkey—  
> riding on a donkey’s colt.

When this king returns, war will end, prisoners will be released, and the people will be blessed. The Lord will also battle in defense of his people.

Thus ends today’s fairly standard reading.

**New Testament**

Babylon/maybe Rome/who knows what is compared to a prostitute who causes all of the nations to commit adultery. She rides a beast with seven heads; this beast represents nations. They will all go to war against the Lamb and lose. They also hate the prostitute and will eventually consumer her.

All in all, a rather gruesome day.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Nothing of particular note.
