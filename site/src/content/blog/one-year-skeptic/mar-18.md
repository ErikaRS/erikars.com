**Old Testament**

We are reaching the home stretch on this whole dessert wandering adventure:

> So these are the results of the registration of the people of Israel as conducted by Moses and Eleazar the priest on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. Not one person on this list had been among those listed in the previous registration taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lord had said of them, “They will all die in the wilderness.” Not one of them survived except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.

In other news, when land allocations are being decided, the daughters of Zelophehad get an allotment because their father had died without any sons. We learn that when a man dies without leaving any sons, his land may be passed on to his daughters. But the important part of this story is that the man’s name was Zelophehad! I like it!

God chooses Joshua to lead the Israelites after Moses’ death. It sounds like Moses’ death will be coming up soon.

Finally, we get a review of the regular offerings to be given by the community:

- Daily: 2 one-year-old lambs with no defects. With each lamb, 2 quarts choice flour mixed with 1 quart pure olive oil, and one quart of alcoholic drink.
- On the sabbath: In addition to the normal offering, 2 one-year-old lambs with no defects, 4 quarts of flour moistened with olive oil, and a liquid offering.
- On the first day of each month: In addition to the normal offering, 2 young bulls, one ram, and 7 one-year-old male lambs, all defect free, of course. Plus 6 quarts of flour moistened with olive oil per bull, 4 per ram, and 2 per lamb. Plus 2 quarts of wine per bull, 1/3 gallon for the ram, and one quart for each lamb.

**New Testament**

The time the author of Luke gives for the start of John the Baptist’s ministry is very precise.

> It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler over Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler over Iturea and Traconitis; Lysanias was ruler over Abilene. Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests.

In any case, John starts baptizing people, and he rants at them when he comes to them.

> When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, “You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee God’s coming wrath? Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.”

At the end of today’s reading, we read about how John baptizes Jesus.

> One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form, descended on him like a dove. And a voice from heaven said, “You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.”

 Maybe I’ll be able to get into this book more once I have recovered from the hour time shift.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Nothing of particular note.
