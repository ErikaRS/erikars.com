Mentioning the [Brick Testament](http://www.thebricktestament.com/) reminded me of the alternate representations of the Bible out there. For your amusement:

- [The Brick Testament](http://www.thebricktestament.com/)
- [The LOLCat Bible](http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- Conservapedia’s [Conservative Bible Project](http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservative_Bible_Project) (warning: I think the authors might take this one seriously)

What others am I missing?
