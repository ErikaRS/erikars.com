March review, only a few days late! =)

  
Repetition, repetition, repetition. That was the theme of March. The New Testament readings came from the Gospels of Mark and Luke, both of which had significant overlap with the Gospel of Matthew. The Old Testament readings came from Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These contained more new material thank the New Testament readings, but were still highly repetitive (and yet, despite all that, I still don’t know the details of how to kill a sacrificial animal). The psalms continued to rotate between psalms of despair, psalms of praise, and psalms begging for help. The proverbs discovered more ways to say “godly = good, wicked = bad”.  
April does not look to be much better, at least not until we finish Deuteronomy and Luke.
