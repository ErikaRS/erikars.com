**Old Testament**

Descriptions of all the sacrifices to be offered for the various festivals. In summary, lots of bulls, rams, and lambs should get killed and lots of flour should get mixed with olive oil.

**New Testament**

The complete contents of today’s reading is a genealogy of Jesus. As I am sure we all know, this genealogy does not match the one in [Matthew 1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%201&version=NLT). There are two traditional apologetics for this. One of the genealogies (traditionally Luke’s) is actually Mary’s genealogy, not Joseph’s, as the text states. Alternately, Joseph had two fathers (e.g., a biological father and a legal one). Neither of these positions has textual support, and it seems much more likely to me that they were both just made up. Wikipedia has a much more [detailed discussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus).

Of less import but almost as much interest, Luke’s genealogy goes from the present back all the way to Noah while Matthew’s genealogy goes forward from Abraham.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Today’s psalm is pleasant (although still on the inexhaustible topic of protection from enemies).

> Let all that I am wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him.
