**Old Testament**

Not feeling terribly inspired today.

Saul continues to degrade and David continues to grow in strength.

David starts a band of outlaw warriors. Saul justifies his desire to kill David by convincing himself that David is conspiring against him.  Doeg and Saul are jerks for murdering a Ahimelech, his fellow priests, and their families for helping David (even though Ahimelech did not even know David was fleeing Saul). David continues to hide from Saul.

**New Testament**

Jesus talks about how he is the shepherd who cares for his sheep. All who came before him were thieves and robbers who tried to deceive the sheep. He is such a good shepherd that he will voluntarily give his life for his sheep.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

The first lines of today’s psalm are insightful:

> Not to us, O Lord, not to us,  
> but to your name goes all the glory  
> for your unfailing love and faithfulness.

Even though I do not believe in God, I do see people (myself not included) giving too much credit to themselves when so much of their success is due to the kindness of others and circumstance.
