Inspired my my shiny new Kindle, I hope to read the whole Protestant Bible in 2010. I will follow the Tyndale One Year Bible plan. I followed this same course of readings in 2007.  I did not take notes then; this project is an attempt to remedy that.

I am an atheist raised in a American Protest culture, so I take that view in my reading. As a consequence, my comments will be skeptical but are unlikely to significantly deviate from social and cultural context provided by Protestant America.

My interpretation style will be mostly literal. By that, I mean that I will interpret my readings literally even though I realize that most Christians do not interpret the whole Bible literally. Since each group of Christians uses different criteria for choosing which parts to interpret literally, I cannot hope to make the “right” choices, so instead I will try to apply a uniformly literal interpretation to all passages presented as historical fact.

The [Tyndale One Year Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Year-Bible-Living-Translation-ebook/dp/B001AS6H1C/) has 365 readings which go through the whole Bible. Each day’s reading includes a passage from the Old Testament, the Psalms, Proverbs, and the New Testament. Within each section, passages are in order. The translation is the [New Living Translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Living_Translation)

I will comment on each day’s reading. In addition, each post will have reference links to that day’s reading in the [Bible Gateway version of the New Living Translation](http://www.biblegateway.com/), links to the Wikipedia articles on the books that day’s readings come from and annotation counts from the [Skeptic’s Annotated Bible](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/a) (that lasted the three days until I went back to work. Manual counting is time consuming). The annotations in the Skeptic’s Annotated Bible mark various acts of violence, absurdities, contradictions, etc. I do not always agree with them, but I think they are still useful to include.

I may occassionally make supplementary posts which provide further discussion of the Bible itself. However, I will avoid posts on current events. Although I may feel tempted to comment, I feel that distracts from the core purpose of this project: to read the Bible and comment upon it.

The name of this blog is a play on the idea of a One Year Bible.  I would like to state, for the record, that I am always a skeptic, not just for one year.  =)
