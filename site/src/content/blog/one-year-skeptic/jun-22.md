**Old Testament**

Too tired for commentary, so I’ll settle with making sure we all stay up to date on the plot.

Moab rebels. Joram attacks. Jehoshaphat joins. King of Edom joins. Elisha calls on God for miraculous water. Elisha predicts victory for Joram and co. Joram and co. win.

Elisha calls forth miraculous oil, reminiscent of the loaves and fish (if “reminiscent” is the right word for a book that came long before the gospels). Elisha promises a woman a son in her old age reminiscent of all of the other babies given to those who could not have them.

**New Testament**

Paul and Barnabas are mistaken for Greek gods (Hermes and Zeus, respectively). They protest against it. They almost fail to restrain the people from sacrificing to them. The crowd proves fickle. Paul is stoned. He lives. They travel to other cities. They travel back to Antioch.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Violent psalm. Good proverb.
