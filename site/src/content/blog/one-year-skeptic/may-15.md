**Old Testament**

The story of David and Goliath, a classic! Goliath, the Philistine champion, stood nine feet tall in heavy bronze armor. He taunted the Israelites to send a champion to fight him. The consequence would be slavery for the nation whose champion lost. David persuades Saul to let him fight Goliath. Armed only with some rocks, a sling, and the faith that God will not let his people be defeated. With a single head shot, David brings down Goliath. After that, the Israelites easily defeat the rest of the Philistine army.

One thing that is interesting of this story is that it does not fit at all with yesterday’s reading. In yesterday’s reading, we read how Saul heard of David’s ability to play the harp and sent for him. In today’s reading, Saul obviously does not know David:

> As Saul watched David go out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?”

> “I really don’t know,” Abner declared.

> “Well, find out who he is!” the king told him.

Even if we allow these stories to be in the opposite chronological order, things still do not work out. In yesterday’s reading, we read that Saul sent for David to play the harp for him. Today we read that after the battle,

> From that day on Saul kept David with him and wouldn’t let him return home.

**Obviously, we once again have two different narratives smooshed together.**

New Testament

Jesus continues to spew on about how he is awesome and in tune with God. Is the Gospel of John done yet?

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Another nice praise filled psalm with no wishes for violence to others.

Today’s proverb:

> Even Death and Destruction hold no secrets from the Lord.  
> How much more does he know the human heart!

I would generally interpret Death and Destruction holding no secrets from the Lord as God knowing all about them. However, given all of the violence in the Old Testament, I am currently inclined toward the interpretation is that is a reference to how effective God is at killing and destroying.
