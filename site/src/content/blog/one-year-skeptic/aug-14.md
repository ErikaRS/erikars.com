**Old Testament**

So, the first part of today’s reading, [Nehemiah 7:61-73](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%207:61-73&version=NLT), is pretty much word for word the same as [Ezra 2:59-70](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra%202:59-70&version=NLT). Boring!

The rest is not much more interesting. Ezra reads the law of Moses to the people, they paid attention and worshiped the Lord, celebrated the festival of shelters, and then listened to a recap of the adventures of the Israelites from Abraham to the 40 years of wandering.

The idea of a festival where you build yourself a shelter still entertains me, so at least that bit was interesting.

**New Testament**

Paul discusses how it was within his rights to expect the support of the churches he founded, but he never took advantage of that right. Reminds me of Nehemiah.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

I do not think I get this proverb:

> If you punish a mocker, the simpleminded become wise;  
> if you instruct the wise, they will be all the wiser.

The second part is pretty clear, but the first part confuses me. I am guessing the author is saying that people learn from seeing others punished? I suppose so although there is much proof to support that punishment is among the least effective ways to regulate behavior.
