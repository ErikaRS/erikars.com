**Old Testament**

Further descriptions of the future temple. Or the present temple? I’m not completely sure.

In any case, we can add another day and a half to the completely and utterly useless readings. I wish I had kept track of this throughout so that I could tally how many weeks we would save if we through out all of the word-for-word redundant passages and all of the passages (like today’s) which contain needlessly detailed descriptions.

**New Testament**

Today’s reading contains a number of pronouncements against certain behaviors

- quarrels and fights among believers: which are due to evil desires within
- friendship with the world: which will make you an enemy of God
- judging others: because it amounts to a criticism and judging of God’s law
- self confidence, especially in predictions about the future: because you don’t know the future

In short, some good advice mixed with some questionable justifications, but nothing particularly mind boggling.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Today we have one of those proverbs where I cannot puzzle out the connection between the first and second lines except in so far as both are bad:

> A poor person who oppresses the poor  
> is like a pounding rain that destroys the crops.

I wonder what Paul would think of this next proverb:
> To reject the law is to praise the wicked;  
> to obey the law is to fight them.

I would quibble with the second part of today’s final proverb:
> Evil people don’t understand justice,  
> but those who follow the Lord understand completely.
