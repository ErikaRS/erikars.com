**Old Testament**

Ahithophel and Hushai (David’s spy) give Absalom conflicting advice. Absalom decides to take Hushai’s advice. This is because,

> the Lord had determined to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel, which really was the better plan, so that he could bring disaster on Absalom!

So the Lord could make Absalom take advice that would lead to his defeat but could not jigger things to prevent the situation from getting to this point in the first place (e.g., by giving David the strength to stick around and nip this situation in the bud)?

Hushai also sends a warning to David. As part of that, we get to hear about folks hiding in a well. Always amusing.

**New Testament**

Today we read something rather interesting:

> Standing near the cross were Jesus’ mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene.

So Jesus’ mother’s sister was named Mary? Umm, wasn’t his mother named Mary? So are they both named Mary? Or is John just pulling from a different tradition where Jesus’ mother is not named Mary?

Then Jesus dies and is put in a tomb. Hmmm, I wonder what will happen next.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

פ (pe), צ (tsadhe), and ק (qoph).

The current proverbs are about kingly behavior. It is not particularly interesting in and of itself, but it is an interesting contrast to the behavior David is showing in the OT readings.
