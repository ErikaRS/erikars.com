**Old Testament**

> I will go over the background information for 1 Samuel tomorrow (or maybe the next day). Today, I want to be quick so I can get to bed.

This is another story that involves the birth of a special person. In this case, Samuel.

> Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.

Hannah wishes for a child, and eventually prays to God for one. That story is hilarious, almost as hilarious as the angel making it so [Zechariah could not speak](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%201:18-22&version=NLT).

> As she was praying to the Lord, Eli watched her. Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound, he thought she had been drinking. “Must you come here drunk?” he demanded. “Throw away your wine!”

> “Oh no, sir!” she replied. “I haven’t been drinking wine or anything stronger. But I am very discouraged, and I was pouring out my heart to the Lord. Don’t think I am a wicked woman! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow.”

> “In that case,” Eli said, “go in peace! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him.”

> “Oh, thank you, sir!” she exclaimed. Then she went back and began to eat again, and she was no longer sad.

Hannah’s desires came to past. She had a child and dedicated him to the Lord. The son, Samuel, became a valued assistant to Eli the priest, and God gave Hannah three more sons and two daughters.

**New Testament**

Jesus heals a lame man. Later, Jesus sees the man again and tells him to stop sinning. We are not told what the man’s sin was.

Jesus once again claims to be the son of God.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

We finish the history lesson psalm with a super brief summary of the wanderings in the dessert and the conquering of the promised land. This super summarized version leaves out all of the times God wanted to completely destroy the Israelites.

> They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;  
> he satisfied their hunger with manna—bread from heaven.  
> He split open a rock, and water gushed out  
> to form a river through the dry wasteland.

If I remember correctly, the quail incident and one of the miraculous water incidents (though perhaps not this one) resulted in God killing or threatening to kill many or all of the Israelites.

Good proverb today:

> People with understanding control their anger;  
> a hot temper shows great foolishness.
