**Old Testament**

Job is talking a lot today. In summary: People don’t know where to find wisdom. Wisdom is more valuable than anything else. Only God understands how to gain wisdom. Wisdom is fear of the Lord. Job’s life use to be really awesome. Now it’s not.

What *is* wisdom? What’s the definition? People always go on about how difficult it is to find wisdom and can only come from their source of preference, but I wonder how much of that is just a lack of a good definition.

**New Testament**

Shorter reading than usual today. Paul talks about his travels and preaching and about how his “Christ-like fragrance” is stinky to non-believers.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Decent proverb,

> Just as the rich rule the poor,  
> so the borrower is servant to the lender.
