**Old Testament**

Nothing of interest today. Today’s reading contains a detailed description of the building of the Tabernacle and describes how the people of Israel were so generous they donated more than enough supplies for everything. This pretty much repeats the earlier description of what the Tabernacle should be like.

**New Testament**

We finally get to the crucifixion, and I have nothing interesting to say about it. Plus, I am feeling snarky. Moral of the story: do not stay up late bowling with friends. =)

The Roman soldiers force some dude named Simon to carry Jesus’ cross for awhile. This is surprising, because the standard story I hear is that Simon volunteered to carry Jesus’ cross because he was faithful or something. Maybe we will read that version in one of the other gospels.

The people passing by mock Jesus as he is tortured to death (at least, I consider crucifixion a form of torture). Then Jesus dies.

> At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud void, *“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”*which means “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”

If Jesus is wholly one with God in some supposedly intentionally confusing trinity, what does it mean when Jesus asks why God has abandoned him?

Jesus’ death causes quite a commotion.

> Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit. At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart, and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead. They left the cemetery after Jesus’ resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.

It seems odd that no surviving records outside the Bible corroborate this claim. If I were like those people who say evolution could not have happened because we have not found all transitional forms, then I would be forced to conclude that these things probably did not happen at Jesus’ death because there is not 100% certain evidence for them. Oh wait! No I wouldn’t, because then I would assume the Bible is special.

Jesus gets buried by Joseph of Arimathea, and the priests decide to put a guard at the tomb to make sure Jesus’ body is not stolen by his followers.

**Psalms and Proverbs**

Finally, we get to some wisdom in Proverbs, and it is actually pretty good.

> Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get an insult in return.  
> Anyone who corrects the wicked will get hurt.  
> So don’t bother correcting mockers;  
> they will only hate you.  
> But correct the wise,  
> and they will love you.
